</span></span><a name="_Toc104622493">Introduction</a></h1>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Welcome to ZoneMinder, the all-in-one Linux GPL'd
security camera solution.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>A while back my garage was burgled and all my power tools
were stolen! I realised shortly after that if I'd just had a camera overlooking
the door then at least I'd have know exactly when and who did the dirty deed.
And so ZoneMinder was born. It's still relatively new but hopefully it has
developed to be something that can be genuinely useful and prevent similar
incidents or even perhaps bring some perpetrators to justice.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>ZoneMinder is designed around a series of independent
components that only function when necessary limiting any wasted resource and
maximising the efficiency of your machine. A fairly ancient Pentium II PC
should be able to track one camera per device at up to 25 frames per second
with this dropping by half approximately for each additional camera on the same
device. Additional cameras on other devices do not interact so can maintain
this frame rate. Even monitoring several cameras still will not overload the
CPU as frame processing is designed to synchronise with capture and not stall
it.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As well as being fast ZoneMinder is designed to be
friendly and even more than that, actually useful. As well as the fast video
interface core it also comes with a user friendly and comprehensive PHP based
web interface allowing you to control and monitor your cameras from home or
even at work or on the road. It supports variable web capabilities based on
available bandwidth. The web interface also allows you to view events that your
cameras have captured and archive them or review them time and again, or delete
the ones you no longer wish to keep. The web pages directly interact with the
core daemons ensuring full co-operation at all times. ZoneMinder can even be
installed as a system service ensuring it is right there if your computer has
to reboot for any reason.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The core of ZoneMinder is the capture and analysis of
images and there is a highly configurable set of parameters that allow you to
ensure that you can eliminate false positives whilst ensuring that anything you
don't want to miss will be captured and saved. ZoneMinder allows you to define
a set of 'zones' for each camera of varying sensitivity and functionality. This
allows you to eliminate regions that you don't wish to track or define areas
that will alarm if various thresholds are exceeded in conjunction with other
zones.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>ZoneMinder is fresh off the keyboard and so comes with no
warranty whatsoever, please try it, send your feedback and if you get anything
useful out of it let me know.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>ZoneMinder is free but if you do get ZoneMinder up and
running and find it useful then please feel free to visit <a
href="http://www.zoneminder.com/donate.html">http://www.zoneminder.com/donate.html</a>
where <b>any donations will be appreciated</b> and will help to fund future
improvements to ZoneMinder. This would be especially relevant if you use
ZoneMinder as part of your business, or to protect your property.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc104622494"><span style='text-decoration:none'>2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Requirements</a></h1>

<p class=MsoPlainText>ZoneMinder needs a couple of things to work.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Firstly, it uses MySQL so you'll need that. In order to
compile you need to make sure you have a development installation and not just
a runtime; this is because it needs to use the MySQL header files. If you are
running an RPM based distribution then its probably worth installing all the
pure mysql rpm files to be sure you have the right ones.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Next it does things with JPEGs so you'll need at least
libjpeg.a which I think come as standard nowadays with most distributions. Users
have reported varying degrees of success with other jpeg libraries such as
jpeg-mmx but these are not officially supported. It also uses the netpbm
utilities in a very limited way to generate thumbnails under certain
circumstances though this can be modified.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>ZoneMinder can generate MPEG videos if necessary, for
this you'll need either ffmpeg (recommended) or the Berkeley MPEG encoder
(mpeg_encode). If you don't have either, don't worry, as the options will be hidden
and you'll not really miss too much. Some of the authentication uses openssl
MD5 functions, if you get a grumble about these during configuration all it
will mean is that authentication wont be used for streaming. The web interface
uses PHP and so you need that in your apache or other web server as well, make
sure MySQL support is available either statically or as a module. There are
also various perl modules that you may need that vary depending on which
options you choose on installation, for more details see later in this
document.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Finally, there is quite a bit of image streaming in the
package. So if you don't have Netscape or another browser that supports image
streaming natively I recommend you get the excellent Cambozola java applet from
<span class=MsoHyperlink>http://www.charliemouse.com/code/cambozola/</span>
which will let you view the image stream in Internet Explorer and others.
Otherwise you're limited to just refreshing still images.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Hardware-wise, ZoneMinder has been used with various
video and USB cameras with the V4L interface. I don't have a lot of cameras
myself so I've not had change to test it with a huge range personally however
there is a list of devices that are definitely known to work on the web site.
Please let me know if your camera works and is not listed. You do need to have
Video4Linux installed. I've not got too many machines so I've only really used
it on various RedHat/Fedora distributions, which seem to have everything there
by default I think. SlackWare does need a bit more tinkering than other distributions;
there is a document on the web site describing what users have had to do to get
it working. Please give me feedback on other distributions not listed on the
site.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc104622495"><span style='text-decoration:none'>3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Building</a></h1>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The first thing you need to do is run the included
configure script to define some initial configuration, just type</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><i>./configure --with-mysql=&lt;your MySQL root&gt;
--with-webdir=&lt;your web directory&gt; --with-cgidir=&lt;your cgi
directory&gt;</i></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>where <i>--with-mysql</i> identifies the root directory
where you have installed MySQL (usually /usr), <i>--with-webdir</i> is the
directory to which you want to install the PHP files, and <i>--with-cgidir</i>
is the directory to which you want to install CGI files. These directories
could be <i>/var/www/html/zm</i> and <i>/var/www/cgi-bin</i> for example. If
you want to use real MPEG based streaming you will need to have built and
installed the ffmpeg tools. You can then also use <i>with-ffmpeg=&lt;path to
ffmpeg root&gt;</i> to help configure find it if its not installed in a
default location. Note, you have to make sure you have installed the ffmpeg
headers and libraries rather than just the binaries, or a development package
with them in. Additionally if you have built ffmpeg with the mp3lame feature
turned on you may additionally need to tell configure where to find that the
mp3lame library, to prevent unresolved dependencies. To do this add the <i>with-lame=&lt;path
to lame directory&gt;</i>option as well. There are also two further arguments
you can add if your web user and group are not both 'apache'. These are <i>--with-webuser</i>
and <i>--with-webgroup</i>. Type</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><i>./configure help</i></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>for details on these options.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>That's the build configuration sorted out. The next thing
you have to do is do a little more runtime specific configuration. ZoneMinder
configuration is scattered around various files in the distribution so to make
things easier for you there is a ZoneMinder configuration utility included.
Type</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><i>perl ./zmconfig.pl</i></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>to get it started. It is an interactive utility and will
prompt you by asking you various questions. For most questions typing '?' will
give you additional help if you need it. Once you've answered all the questions
it will write out a configuration file called 'zmconfig.txt' and then process
various files to substitute the information in them. If you run it again it
will remember your answers from. If you just want to rerun the substitutions
you can run zmconfig.pl in non-interactive mode by typing</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><i>perl ./zmconfig.pl -noi</i></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>which will just read your file and do the substitutions
with no questions asked. There are two classes of options, core options which
much be specified with zmconfig which detail things such as database passwords
which are compiled into ZoneMinder and other options with are stored in the
database and which can be modified dynamically via the options section of the
web interface. Only the first set need to be completed with zmconfig at this
stage. If you want to change just a few options and cant access the options
dialog via the web you can append them as parameters to zmconfig and it will
just ask you about those. So for example,</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><i>perl ./zmconfig.pl ZM_STRICT_VIDEO_CONFIG</i></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>however it is fairly dumb and will not tell you if you
make a typo and misspell an option.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Among the first questions zmconfig.pl asks you are to do
with the database and the next thing you should do is create it and the
associated database user. The included schema (zmschema.sql) can be used to
actually create the tables required. The database is usually called just 'zm'
but can be anything you like.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>If you are a first time user the first run of zmconfig.pl
will warn you about the missing database, you can ignore those errors this
time. Once youve run it for the first time the schema file should have your
desired database name in it so use it to create the database (see below). Once
the database and permissions are set up rerun zmconfig.pl with the noi option
to get it to load the configuration into your new database.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>If you are upgrading from a previous version you can use
zmalter-x.y.z.sql to upgrade your database and make the necessary changes where
x.y.z identifies the version of ZoneMinder you had installed previously. So if
you are going from version 0.9.7 to version 0.9.11 you would run the scripts
for all intervening versions to get to the current one, i.e. zmalter-0.9.7.sql,
zmalter-0.9.8.sql, zmalter-0.9.9.sql and zmalter0.9.10.sql. Alternatively from
version 1.19.5 you can use the zmupdate.pl script to do all the updating for
you, this will include all the database changes plus any other tweaks necessary
to upgrade to the latest version. To use it you should type</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><i>zmupdate.pl version=&lt;previous version&gt;
[--user=&lt;db user&gt; --pass=&lt;db password&gt;]</i></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>where previous version relates to the version of ZM you
are upgrading from, 1.19.4 for example. All updates from that versions onwards
will be applied, however zmupdate.pl will only work with upgrades from 1.19.0
onwards. The user and pass options allow you to specify a database user and
password with sufficient privilege to alter the structure of the database.
This is not necessarily the database user you use for ZoneMinder itself as
specified in the section below.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>For a new installation the simplest way to create your
database and users is as follows,</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><i>mysql mysql &lt; zmschema.sql</i></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><i>mysql mysql</i></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><i>grant select,insert,update,delete on &lt;your database
name&gt;.* to '&lt;username&gt;'@localhost identified by '&lt;password&gt;';</i></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><i>quit</i></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><i>mysqladmin reload</i></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>You may need to supply a username and password to the
mysql commands in the first place to give yourself sufficient privileges to
perform the required commands. If you want to host your database on a different
machine than that which ZoneMinder is running on then use the hostname of the
remote machine instead of localhost.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Then just type <i>'make'</i> and off you go.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc104622496"><span style='text-decoration:none'>4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Installation</a></h1>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Once the build has completed you should have several
shiny new binaries. I will now briefly describe what each of them does.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmc</b> - This is the
ZoneMinder Capture daemon. This binary's job is to sit on a video device and
suck frames off it as fast as possible, this should run at more or less
constant speed.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zma</b> - This is the
ZoneMinder Analysis daemon. This is the component that goes through the
captured frames and checks them for motion which might generate an alarm or
event. It generally keeps up with the Capture daemon but if very busy may skip
some frames to prevent it falling behind.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmf</b> - This is the
ZoneMinder Frame daemon. This is an optional daemon that can run in concert
with the Analysis daemon and whose function it is to actually write captured
frames to disk. This frees up the Analysis daemon to do more analysis (!) and so
keep up with the Capture daemon better. If it isnt running or dies then the
Analysis daemon just writes them itself.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zms</b> - This is the
ZoneMinder Streaming server. The web interface connects with this to get
real-time or historical streamed images. It runs only when a live monitor
stream or event stream is actually being viewed and dies when the event
finishes or the associate web page is closed. If you find you have several zms
processes running when nothing is being viewed then it is likely you need a
patch for apache (see the Troubleshooting section).</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmu</b> - This is the
ZoneMinder Utility. It's basically a handy command line interface to several
useful functions. Its not really meant to be used by anyone except the web
page (there's only limited 'help' in it so far) but can be if necessary,
especially for debugging video problems.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmfix</b> - This is a small
binary that exists only to ensure that the video device files can be read by
the main capture daemons. It is often the case that these device files are set
to be accessible by root only on boot. This binary runs setuid and ensures that
they have appropriate permissions. This is not a daemon and runs only on system
start and then exits.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As well as this there are the web PHP files in the web
directory and some perl scripts in the scripts directory. These scripts all
have some configuration at the top of the files which should be viewed and
amended if necessary and are as follows.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmpkg.pl</b> - This is the
ZoneMinder Package Control script. This is used by the web interface and
service scripts to control the execution of the system as a whole.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmdc.pl</b> - This is the
ZoneMinder Daemon Control script. This is used by the web interface and the
zmpkg.pl script to control and maintain the execution of the capture and
analysis daemons, amongst others. You should not need to run this script
yourself.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmfilter.pl</b> - This
script controls the execution of saved filters and will be started and stopped
by the web interface based on whether there are filters that have been defined
to be autonomous. This script is also responsible for the automatic uploading
of events to a 3rd party server.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmaudit.pl</b> - This
script is used to check the consistency of the event file system and database.
It can delete orphaned events, i.e. ones that appear in one location and not
the other as well as checking that all the various event related tables are in
line. It can be run interactively or in batch mode either from the command line
or a cron job or similar. In the zmconfig.pl there is an option to specify fast
event deletes where the web interface only deletes the event entry from the
database itself. If this is set then it is this script that tidies up the rest.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmwatch.pl</b> - This is a
simple script purely designed to keep an eye on the capture daemons and restart
them if they lockup. It has been known for sync problems in the video drivers
to cause this so this script makes sure that nothing important gets missed.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmupdate.pl</b>  Currently
this script is responsible for checking whether a new version of ZoneMinder is
available and other miscellaneous actions related to upgrades and migrations.
It is also intended to be a one stop shop for any upgrades and will execute
everything necessary to update your installation to a new version.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmx10.pl</b> - This is an
optional script that can be used to initiate and monitor X10 Home Automation
style events and interface with an alarm system either by the generation of X10
signals on ZoneMinder events or by initiating ZoneMinder monitoring and capture
on receipt of X10 signals from elsewhere, for instance the triggering of an X10
PIR. For example I have several cameras that dont do motion detection until I
arm my alarm system whereupon they switch to active mode when an X10 signal is
generated by the alarm system and received by ZoneMinder.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
3.0pt;margin-left:17.85pt'><b>zmtrigger.pl</b> - This is an optional script
that is a more generic solution to external triggering of alarms. It can handle
external connections via either internet socket, unix socket or file/device
interfaces. Currently you have to configure these using the sources array in
the script itself though ultimately I would expect they would be databased. The
format of triggers used by zmtrigger.pl is as follows &lt;id&gt;|&lt;action&gt;|&lt;score&gt;|&lt;cause&gt;|&lt;text&gt;|&lt;showtext&gt;
where</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
3.0pt;margin-left:53.85pt;text-indent:-17.85pt'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>'id' is the id number or name of the ZM monitor</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
3.0pt;margin-left:53.85pt;text-indent:-17.85pt'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>'action' is 'on', 'off', 'cancel' or show where 'on' forces an
alarm condition on, 'off' forces an alarm condition off and 'cancel' negates
the previous 'on' or 'off'. The show action merely updates some auxiliary
text which can optionally be displayed in the images captured by the monitor. Ordinarily
you would use 'on' and 'cancel', 'off' would tend to be used to suppress motion
based events. Additionally 'on' and 'off' can take an additional time offset,
e.g. on+20 which automatically 'cancel's the previous action after that number
of seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
3.0pt;margin-left:53.85pt;text-indent:-17.85pt'><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>'score' is the score given to the alarm, usually to indicate it's
importance. For 'on' triggers it should be non-zero, otherwise it should be

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'>Note that multiple messages

ZoneMinder events.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmcontrol-*.pl</b>  These
are a set of example scripts which can be used to control Pan/Tilt/Zoom class
cameras. Each script converts a set of standard parameters used for camera
control into the actual protocol commands sent to the camera. If you are using
a camera control protocol that is not in the shipped list then you will have to
create a similar script though it can be created entirely separately from
ZoneMinder and does not need to named as these scripts are. Although the
scripts are used to action commands originated from the web interface they can
also be used directly or from other programs or scripts, for instance to
implement periodic scanning to different presets.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zmtrack.pl</b>  This
script is used to manage the experimental motion tracking feature. It is
responsible for detecting that an alarm is taking place and moving the camera
to point to the alarmed location, and then subsequently returning it to a
defined standby location. As well as moving the camera it also controls when
motion detection is suspended and restored so that the action of the camera
tracking does not trigger endless further alarms which are not justified.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:18.0pt'><b>zm</b> - This is the
(optional) ZoneMinder init script, see below for details.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Finally, check zm_config.php in the web directory and
amend any configuration necessary in there. Most will have already been done by
the configuration utilities but some scripts have a VERBOSE flag you can set
to get more debug out.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>At this stage typing 'make install' will install
everything to the desired locations, you may wish to su to root first though.
The installation routine will copy the binaries and scripts to your chosen
install location, usually /usr/local/bin and then move zms to your cgi-bin
area. It will then copy the web files to your chosen directory and ensure they
have the right permissions. Finally it tries to link zm.php to index.php but
will not overwrite an existing file if it already exists.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The 'zm' script does not get installed automatically as
it is not necessary for the operation of the ZoneMinder setup per se and is not
necessarily supported for distributions other than those from the RedHat or
Fedora families. However if you want to ensure that the ZoneMinder daemons are
started on reboot etc copy it to your init.d directory, usually something like
/etc/rc.d/init.d and then add it by doing</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><i>chkconfig --add zm</i></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>or similar command for your distribution. ZoneMinder will
then start up when your machine reboots and can be controlled (by the root
user) by doing <i>'service zm start'</i> or <i>'service zm stop'</i> etc. You
may need to use the <span class=CommandChar>levels</span> parameter to
chkconfig to ensure that ZoneMinder is started when you need it to.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Now start your web browser, point it at your zm.php and
off you go.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>What you see now (and subsequently) depends on whether
you chose to run ZoneMinder in authenticated mode or not. This is an option
that lets you specify whether anyone that goes to the ZoneMinder web pages must
authenticate themselves in order to be given permissions to perform certain
tasks. If you chose this mode then you will need to log in here. By default a
fully privileged user admin has been created with a password also of admin.
You should change this password as soon as possible.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Once youve logged in, or if you are running in
un-authenticated mode, you will now see the ZoneMinder Console window. This
will resize itself to avoid being too intrusive on your desktop. Along the top
there are several informational entries like the time of the last update and
the current server load. There will also be an indication of the system state
which will probably say stopped to start with. This is a link that you can
click on to control the ZoneMinder system as a whole. Below that are various
other links including one detailing the current user (in authenticated mode
only) and one allowing you to configure your bandwidth. This last one enables
you to optimise your settings depending on where you are, the actual values relating
to this are defined in the options. If you are using a browser on the same
machine or network then choose high, over a cable or DSL link maybe choose
medium and over a dialup choose low. You can experiment to see which is best.

<h2><a name="_Toc104622499"><span style='text-decoration:none'>6.1.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defining
Monitors</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>To use ZoneMinder properly you need to define at least
one Monitor. Essentially, a monitor is associated with a camera and can
continually check it for motion detection and such like. So, next click 'Add
New Monitor' to bring up the dialog. You will see a bunch of things you have to
fill in.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>To help you get started on the video configuration the
best thing is to use a tool like 'xawtv' (<a href="http://bytesex.org/xawtv/">http://bytesex.org/xawtv/</a>)
to get a picture you're happy with, and to check your camera works. Please note
that just because you can see a video stream in these tools does not
necessarily guarantee that your camera will work with ZoneMinder. This is
because most tools just map the video image through onto screen memory
transparently without intercepting it, whereas ZoneMinder needs to capture the
image and, usually, inspect it. This is called frame grabbing and to check it
you should use the facility in xawtv, or other tool, to capture either one or
more still images or possibly a movie. If this works and the images or movie
are not garbage then the chances are that ZoneMinder will work fine also.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Once you have validated your camera run 'zmu -d
&lt;device_no&gt; -q -v' to get a dump of the settings (note, you will have to
additionally supply a username and password to zmu if you are running in
authenticated mode). You can then enter these values into the video related
options of the monitor configuration panel. The 'device_no' referred to here is
a number corresponding to the digit at the end of your device file, so
/dev/video0 has a 'device_no' of 0 etc. If 'zmu' gives you an error related to
permissions run 'zmfix -a' to make sure you can access all the video devices.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The options are divided into a set of tabs to make it
easier to edit. You do not have to save to change to different tab so you can
make all the changes you require and then click Save at the end. The
individual option are explained in a little more detail below,</p>

<p class=MonitorTab>Monitor Tab</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Name</b>  The name for your monitor. This should be
made up of alphanumeric characters (a-z,A-Z,0-9) and hyphen (-) and
underscore(_) only. Whitespace is not allowed.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Function</b> <b> </b>This essentially defines what
the monitor is doing. This can be one of the following; </p>

<p class=MonitorBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>'None' <b> </b>The monitor is currently disabled and no streams
can be viewed or events generated.</p>

<p class=MonitorBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>'Monitor' <b> </b>The monitor will only stream feeds but no
image analysis is done and so no alarms or events will be generated, </p>

<p class=MonitorBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>'Modect'  or MOtion DEteCTtion. All captured images will be
analysed and events generated where motion is detected.</p>

<p class=MonitorBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Record  In this case continuous events of a fixed length are
generated regardless of motion which is analogous to a convention time-lapse
video recorder. No motion detection takes place in this mode.</p>

<p class=MonitorBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Mocord  This is a hybrid of Modect and Record and results in
both fixed length events being recorded and also any motion being highlighted
within those events.</p>

<p class=MonitorBullet><span style='font-family:Symbol'>·<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>'Nodect'  or No DEteCTtion. This is a special mode designed to
be used with external triggers. In Nodect no motion detection takes place but
events are recorded if external triggers require it.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption>Generally speaking it is best to choose Monitor as an
initial setting here..</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Section Length</b>  This specifies the length (in
seconds) of any fixed length events produced when the monitor function is
Record or Mocord. Otherwise it is ignored. This should not be so long that
events are difficult to navigate nor so short that too many events are
generated. A length of between 300 and 900 seconds I recommended.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Frame Skip </b> This setting also applies only to
the Record or Mocord functions and specifies how many frames should be
skipped in the recorded events. The default setting of zero results in every
captured frame being saved. Using a value of one would mean that one frame is
skipped between each saved, two means that two frames are skipped between each
saved frame etc. An alternate way of thinking is that one in every Frame Skip
+ 1 frames is saved. The point of this is to ensure that saved events do not
take up too much space unnecessarily whilst still allowing the camera to
capture at a fairly high frame rate. The alternate approach is to limit the
capture frame rate which will obviously affect the rate at which frames are
saved.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Run Mode </b> Two choices are available here.
Continuous is the usual setting and means that the monitor is expected to be
performing the function selected above at all times and should one or more of
the daemons fail or not be running it will be automatically restarted. By
contrast Triggered means that the decision about whether the daemons should
actually be active is devolved to an external triggering mechanism.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Triggers </b> This small section lets you select
which triggers will apply if the run mode has been set to triggered above.
The most common trigger is X10 and this will appear here if you indicated that
your system supported it during installation. Only X10 is supported as a
shipped trigger with ZoneMinder at present but it is possible that other
triggers will become available as necessary. You can also just use cron jobs
or other mechanisms to actually control the camera and keep them completely
outside of the ZoneMinder settings. The zmtrigger.pl script is also available
to implement custom external triggering.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Source Type</b>  This determines whether the camera
is a local one attached to a physical video or USB port on your machine or a
remote network camera or similar. Choosing one or the other affects which set
of options are shown in the next tab.</p>

<p class=MonitorTab>Source Tab (local device)</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Device Number/Channel</b>  For a local camera enter
the device number that your camera is attached to. If it is /dev/video0 enter
'0' etc. Some video devices, e.g. BTTV cards support multiple cameras on one
device so in this case enter the channel number in the Channel box or leave it
at zero if you're using a USB camera or one with just one channel. </p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Device Format</b>  For a local camera enter the
video format of the video stream. This is defined in various system files (e.g.
/usr/include/linux/videodev.h) but the two most common are 0 for PAL and 1 for
NTSC.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Capture Palette</b> <b> </b>Finally for the video
part of the configuration enter the colour depth. ZoneMinder supports a handful
of the most common palettes, so choose one here. If in doubt try grey first,
and then 24 bit colour. If neither of these work very well then YUV420P or one
of the others probably will. There is a slight performance penalty when using
palettes other than grey or 24 bit colour as an internal conversion is
involved. These other formats are intended to be supported natively in a future
version but for now if you have the choice choose one of grey or 24 bit colour.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Capture Width/Height</b> <b> </b>The dimensions of
the video stream your camera will supply. If your camera supports several just
enter the one you'll want to use for this application, you can always change it
later. However I would recommend starting with no larger than 320x240 or
352x288 and then perhaps increasing and seeing how performance is affected.
This size should be adequate in most cases. Some cameras are quite choosy about
the sizes you can use here so unusual sizes such as 197x333 should be avoided
initially.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Orientation</b>  If your camera is mounted upside
down or at right angles you can use this field to specify a rotation that is
applied to the image as it is captured. This incurs an additional processing
overhead so if possible it is better to mount your camera the right way round
if you can. If you choose one of the rotation options remember to switch the
height and width fields so that they apply, e.g. if your camera captures at
352x288 and you choose Rotate Right here then set the height to be 352 and
width to be 288. You can also choose to flip the image if your camera
provides mirrored input.</p>

<p class=MonitorTab>Source Tab (remote device)</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Remote Host/Port/Path</b>  For remote cameras use
these fields to enter the full URL of the camera. Basically if your camera is
at <span class=MsoHyperlink>http://camserver.home.net:8192/cameras/camera1.jpg</span>
then these fields will be camserver.home.net, 8192 and /cameras/camera1.jopg
respectively. Leave the port at 80 if there is no special port required. If you
require authentication to access your camera then add this onto the host name
in the form &lt;username&gt;:&lt;password&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;.com.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Remote Image Colours </b> Specify the amount of
colours in the captured image. Unlike with local cameras changing this has no
controlling effect on the remote camera itself so ensure that your camera is
actually capturing to this palette beforehand.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Capture Width/Height</b>  As per local devices.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Orientation</b>  As per local devices.</p>

<p class=MonitorTab>Timestamp Tab</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Timestamp Label Format</b> <b> </b>This relates to
the timestamp that is applied to each frame. It is a strftime style string.
It is actually passed through strftime and then through printf to add the
monitor name so a format of '%%s - %y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S' (note the double % at the
beginning) would be recommended though you can modify it if necessary. If you
dont want a timestamp or have a camera that puts one on itself then leave this
field blank. If you add a second %%s placeholder in the string this will be
filled by any of the show text detailed in the zmtriggers.pl section.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Timestamp Label X/Y</b> <b> </b>The X and Y values
determine where to put the timestamp. A value of 0 for the X value will put it
on the left side of the image and a Y value of 0 will place it at the top of
the image. To place the timestamp at the bottom of the image use a value eight
less than the image height.</p>

<p class=MonitorTab>Buffers Tab</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Image Buffer Size</b> <b> </b>This option determines
how many frames are held in the ring buffer at any one time. The ring buffer is
the storage space where the last n images are kept, ready to be resurrected
on an alarm or just kept waiting to be analysed. It can be any value you like
with a couple of provisos, (see next options). However it is stored in shared
memory and making it too large especially for large images with a high colour depth
can use a lot of memory. A value of no more than 50  is usually ok. If you find
that your system will not let you use the value you want it is probably because
your system has an arbitrary limit on the size of shared memory that may be
used even though you may have plenty of free memory available. This limit is
usually fairly easy to change, see the Troubleshooting section for details.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Warm-up Frames  </b>This specifies how many frames
the analysis daemon should process but not examine when it starts. This allows
it to generate an accurate reference image from a series of images before
looking too carefully for any changes. I use a value of 25 here, too high and
it will take a long time to start, too low and you will get false alarms when
the analysis daemon starts up.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Pre/Post Event Image Buffer</b> <b> </b>These
options determine how many frames from before and after an event should be
preserved with it. This allows you to view what happened immediately prior and
subsequent to the event. A value of 10 for both of these will get you started
but if you get a lot of short events and would prefer them to run together to
form fewer longer ones then increase the Post Event buffer size. The pre-event
buffer is a true buffer and should not really exceed half the ring buffer size.
However the post-event buffer is just a count that is applied to captured
frames and so can be managed more flexibly. You should also bear in mind the
frame rate of the camera when choosing these values. For instance a network
camera capturing at 1FPS will give you 10 seconds before and after each event
if you chose 10 here. This may well be too much and pad out events more than
necessary. However a fast video card may capture at 25FPS and you will want to
ensure that this setting enables you to view a reasonable time frame pre and
post event.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Alarm Frame Count</b>  This option allows you to
specify how many consecutive alarm frames must occur before an alarm event is
generated. The usual, and default, value is 1 which implies that any alarm
frame will cause or participate in an event. You can enter any value up to 16
here to eliminate bogus events caused perhaps by screen flickers or other
transients. Values over 3 or 4 are unlikely to be useful however. Please note
that if you have statistics recording enabled then currently statistics are not
recorded for the first Alarm Frame Count-1 frames of an event. So if you set
this value to 5 then the first 4 frames will be missing statistics whereas the
more usual value of 1 will ensure that all alarm frames have statistics
recorded.</p>

<p class=MonitorTab>Misc Tab</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Event Prefix</b>  By default events are named
Event-&lt;event id&gt;, however you are free to rename them individually as
you wish. This option lets you modify the event prefix, the Event- part, to
be a value of your choice so that events are named differently as they are
generated. This allows you to name events according to which monitor generated
them. </p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Maximum FPS</b>  On some occasions you may have one
or more cameras capable of high capture rates but find that you generally do
not require this performance at all times and would prefer to lighten the load
on your server. This option permits you to limit the maximum capture rate to a
specified value. This may allow you to have more cameras supported on your
system by reducing the CPU load or to allocate video bandwidth unevenly between
cameras sharing the same video device. This value is only a rough guide and the
lower the value you set the less close the actual FPS may approach it
especially on shared devices where it can be difficult to synchronise two or
more different capture rates precisely. There is a global configuration option
that allows you to turn this limiting off in the event of an alarm.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>FPS Report Interval</b> <b> </b>How often the
current performance in terms of Frames Per Second is output to the system log.
Not used in any functional way so set it to maybe 1000 for now. If you watch
/var/log/messages (normally) you will see this value being emitted at the
frequency you specify both for video capture and processing.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Reference Image Blend %ge</b> <b> </b>Each analysed
image in ZoneMinder is a composite of previous images and is formed by applying
the current image as a certain percentage of the previous reference image.
Thus, if we entered the value of 10 here, each images part in the reference
image will diminish by a factor of 0.9 each time round. So a typical reference
image will be 10% the previous image, 9% the one before that and then 8.1%,
7.2%, 6.5% and so on of the rest of the way. An image will effectively vanish
around 25 images later than when it was added. This blend value is what is
specified here and if higher will make slower progressing events less
detectable as the reference image would change more quickly. Similarly events
will be deemed to be over much sooner as the reference image adapts to the new
images more quickly. In signal processing terms the higher this value the
steeper the event attack and decay of the signal. It depends on your particular
requirements what the appropriate value would be for you but start with 10 here
and adjust it (usually down) later if necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><b>Control <span class=MonitorTabChar>T</span>ab</b></p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Note: This tab and its options will only appear if
you have selected the ZM_OPT_CONTROL option to indicated that your system
contains cameras which are able to be controlled via Pan/Tilt/Zoom or other
mechanisms. See the Camera Control section elsewhere in this document for

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Controllable  </b>Check this box to indicate your
camera can be controlled.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Control Type  </b>Select the control type that is
appropriate for your camera. ZoneMinder ships with a small number of predefined
control protocols which will works with some cameras without modification but
which may have to amended to function with others, Choose the edit link to create
new control types or to edit the existing ones.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Control Device  </b>This is the device that is used
to control your camera. This will normally be a serial or similar port. If your
camera is a network camera, you will generally not need to specify a control device.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Control Address  </b>This is the address of your
camera. Some control protocols require that each camera is identified by a
particular, usually numeric id. If your camera uses addressing then enter the
id of your camera here. If your camera is a network camera then you will
usually need to enter the hostname or IP address of it here. This is ordinarily
the same as that given for the camera itself.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Auto Stop Timeout </b> Some cameras only support a
continuous mode of movement. For instance you tell the camera to pan right and
then when it is aligned correctly you tell it to stop. In some cases it is
difficult to time this precisely over a web interface so this option allows you
to specify an automatic timeout where the command will be automatically stopped.
So a value of 0.25 here can tell the script to stop moving a quarter of a
second after starting. This allows a more precise method of fine control. If
this value is left blank or at zero it will be ignored, if set then it will be
used as the timeout however it will only be applied for the lower 25% of
possible speed ranges. In other words if your camera has a pan speed range of 1
to 100 then selecting to move at 26 or over will be assumed to imply that you
want a larger movement that you can control yourself and no timeout will be
applied. Selecting motion at lower speeds will be interpreted as requiring
finer control and the automatic timeout will be invoked.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Track Motion </b> This and the following four
options are used with the experimental motion function. This will only work if
your camera supports mapped movement modes where a point on an image can be
mapped to a control command. This is generally most common on network cameras
but can be replicated to some degree on other cameras that support relative movement
modes. See the Camera Control section for more details. Check this box to
enable motion tracking.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Track Delay </b> This is the number of seconds to
suspend motion detection for following any movement that the camera may make to
track motion.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Return Location  </b>If you camera supports a home
position or presets you can choose which preset the camera should return to
after tracking motion.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Return Delay  </b>This is the delay, in seconds,
once motion has stopped being detected, before the camera returns to any
defined return location.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption>&nbsp;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><b> X10 <span class=MonitorTabChar>T</span>ab</b></p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>Note: This tab and its options will only appear if
you have indicated that your system supports the X10 home automation protocol
during initial system configuration.</b></p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>X10 Activation String</b> - The contents of this
field determine when a monitor starts and/or stops being active when running in
Triggered; mode and with X10 triggers. The format of this string is as
follows,</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'><u>n</u> : If you simply enter
a number then the monitor will be activated when an X10 ON signal for that unit
code is detected and will be deactivated when an OFF signal is detected.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'><u>!n</u> : This inverts the
previous mode, e.g. !5 means that the monitor is activated when an OFF signal
for unit code 5 is detected and deactivated by an ON.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'><u>n+</u> : Entering a unit
code followed by + means that the monitor is activated on receipt of a ON
signal for that unit code but will ignore the OFF signal and as such will not
be deactivated by this instruction. If you prepend a '!' as per the previous
definition it similarly inverts the mode, i.e. the ON signal deactivates the
monitor.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'><u>n+&lt;seconds&gt;</u> : As
per the previous mode except that the monitor will deactivate itself after the
given number of seconds.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'><u>n-</u> : Entering a unit
code followed by - means that the monitor is deactivated on receipt of a OFF
signal for that unit code but will ignore the ON signal and as such will not be
activated by this instruction. If you prepend a '!' as per the previous
definition it similarly inverts the mode, i.e. the OFF signal activates the
monitor.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'><u>n-&lt;seconds&gt;</u> : As
per the previous mode except that the monitor will activate itself after the
given number of seconds.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption>You can also combine several of these expressions to by
separating them with a comma to create multiple circumstances of activation.
However for now leave this blank.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>X10 Input Alarm String</b> - This has the same format
as the previous field but instead of activating the monitor with will cause a
forced alarm to be generated and an event recorded if the monitor is Active.
The same definition as above applies except that for activated read alarmed and
for deactivated read unalarmed(!). Again leave this blank for now.</p>

<p class=MonitorOption><b>X10 Output Alarm String</b> - This X10 string also
has the same format as the two above options. However it works in a slightly
different way. Instead of ZoneMinder reacting to X10 events this option
controls how ZoneMinder emits X10 signals when the current monitor goes into or
comes out of the alarm state. Thus just entering a number will cause the ON
signal for that unit code to be sent when going into alarm state and the OFF
signal when coming out of alarm state. Similarly 7+30 will send the unit code 7
ON signal when going into alarm state and the OFF signal 30 seconds later
regardless of state. The combination of the X10 instruction allows ZoneMinder
to react intelligently to, and also assume control of, other devices when
necessary. However the indiscriminate use of the Input Alarm and Output Alarm
signals can cause some horrendous race conditions such as a light going on in
response to an alarm which then causes an alarm itself and so on. Thus some
circumspection is required here. Leave this blank for now anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Finally, click 'Save' to add your monitor.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>On the main console listing you will now see your monitor
and some of its vital statistics. Most columns are also links and you get to
other functions of ZoneMinder by choosing the appropriate one. Describing them
left to right, they are as follows.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The first column is the Id, clicking on this gives you
the opportunity to edit any of the settings you have just defined your monitor
to have.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The next column is the Name column, clicking on this will
give you the watch window where you can view a live feed from your camera along
with recent events. This is described more fully below.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Following that are the Function and Source columns, which
may be represented in various colours. Initially both will be showing red. This
means that that monitor is not configured for any function and as a consequence
has no zmc (capture) daemon running on it. If it were orange it would mean that
a zmc daemon was running but no zma (analysis) daemon and green means both are
running. In our case it is red because we defined the Monitor to have a
Function of None so no daemons are required. To get the daemons up and running
you can either click on the source listed in the Source column and edit the
monitor properties or click on the Function listed and change it to Monitor,
which will ensure that one or more appropriate daemons are started
automatically.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Having a device status of red or orange does not
necessarily constitute an error if you have deliberately disabled a monitor or
have just put it into Passive mode.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>If you have several cameras (and thus monitors) on a
device the device status colour reflects all of them for the capture daemon. So
if just one monitor is active then the daemon is active for both even if all
the other monitors are switched off.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Once you have changed the function of your monitor, the
main console window will be updated to reflect this change. If your device
status does not go green then check your system and web server logs to see if
it's something obvious.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>You can now add further monitors if you have cameras set
up to support them. Once you have one or more monitors you may notice the '&lt;n&gt;
Monitors' title becomes a link. Clicking on this link will open up a window
which allows you to assign your monitors to groups. These let you select
certain monitors to view. For instance you may only wish to view outdoor
monitors while indoors. You can also choose to view all of them. If you choose
a group then your selection will be remembered via a cookie and will be used
until you change it. You can call your groups anything you like, though
Mobile has a special meaning (see Mobile Devices below). There may also be a
Cycle link which allows you to cycle through a shot from each of your
monitors (in the selected group unless they are switched off) and get a
streamed or still image from each in turn. Similarly if you see a link titled
Montage it will allow you view all your active enabled cameras (in the
selected group) simultaneously. Be aware however that this can consume large
amounts of bandwidth and CPU so should not be used continuously unless you have
resource to burn. </p>

<h2><a name="_Toc104622500"><span style='text-decoration:none'>6.2.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Defining
Zones</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The next important thing to do with a new monitor is set
up Zones for it to use. By default you'll already have one generated for you
when you created your monitor but you might want to modify it or add others.
Click on the Zones column for your monitor and you should see a small popup
window appear which contains an image from your camera overlain with a stippled
pattern representing your zone. In the default case this will cover the whole
image and will be red. Beneath that will be a table containing a listing of
your zones. Clicking on either the relevant bit of the image or on the Id or
Name in the table will bring up another window where you can edit the
particulars for your Zones. As you can see there are quite a few, so now is a
good time to go through them. The options are as follows.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'><b>Name</b>  This is just a
label to identify the zone by. You can change this to be more representative if
you like, though it isn't used much except for logging and debugging.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'><b>Type</b> - This is one of
the more important concepts in ZoneMinder and there are five to choose from.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'><u>Active</u> : This is the
zone type you'll use most often, and which will be set for your default zone.
This means that this zone will trigger an alarm on any events that occur within
it that meet the selection criteria. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'><u>Inclusive</u> : This zone
type can be used for any zones that you want to trigger an alarm only if at
least one other Active zone has already triggered one. This might be for
example to cover an area of the image like a plant or tree which moves a lot and
which would trigger lots of alarms. Perhaps this is behind an area you'd like
to monitor though, in this case you'd create an active zone covering the
non-moving parts and an inclusive zone covering the tree perhaps with less
sensitive detection settings also. If something triggered an alarm in the
Active zone and also in the Inclusive zone they would both be registered and
the resulting alarm would be that much bigger than if you had blanked it out
altogether.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'><u>Exclusive</u> : The next
zone Type is Exclusive. This means that alarms will only be triggered in this
zone if no alarms have already been triggered in Active zones. This is the most
specialised of the zone types and you may never use it but in its place it is
very useful. For instance in the camera covering my garden I keep watch for a
hedgehog that visits most nights and scoffs the food out of my cats bowls. By
creating a sensitive Exclusive zone in that area I can ensure that a hedgehog
alarm will only trigger if there is activity in that small area. If something
much bigger occurs, like someone walking by it will trigger a regular alarm and
not one from the Exclusive zone. Thus I can ensure I get alarms for big events
and also special small events but not the noise in between.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'><u>Preclusive</u> : This zone type
is relatively recent. It is called a Preclusive zone because if it is triggered
it actually precludes an alarm being generated for that image frame. So motion
or other changes that occur in a Preclusive zone will have the effect of
ensuring that no alarm occurs at all. The application for this zone type is
primarily as a shortcut for detecting general large-scale lighting or other
changes. Generally this may be achieved by limiting the maximum number of alarm
pixels or other measure in an Active zone. However in some cases that zone may
cover an area where the area of variable illumination occurs in different
places as the sun and/or shadows move and it thus may be difficult to come up
with general values. Additionally, if the sun comes out rapidly then although
the initial change may be ignored in this way as the reference image catches up
an alarm may ultimately be triggered as the image becomes less different. Using
one or more Preclusive zones offers a different approach. Preclusive zones are
designed to be fairly small, even just a few pixels across, with quite low
alarm thresholds. They should be situated in areas of the image that are less
likely to have motion occur such as high on a wall or in a corner. Should a
general illumination change occur they would be triggered at least as early as
any Active zones and prevent any other zones from generating an alarm.
Obviously careful placement is required to ensure that they do not cancel any
genuine alarms or that they are not so close together that any motion just hops
from one Preclusive zone to another. As always, the best way is to experiment a
little and see what works for you.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'><u>Inactive </u>: This final
zone type is the opposite of Active. In this zone type no alarms will ever be
reported. You can create an Inactive zone to cover any areas in which nothing
notable will ever happen or where you get constant false alarms that don't
relate to what you are trying to monitor. An Inactive zone can overlay other
zone types and will be processed first.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'>I mentioned above that
Inactive zones may be overlaid on other zones to blank out areas however as a
general principle you should try and make zones abut each other as much as
possible and do not overlap. This helps avoid repeated duplicate processing of
the same area. For instance an Inclusive zone overlaying an Active zone when
all other settings are the same will always trigger when the Active zone does
which somewhat defeats the object of the exercise. One exception to this is
Preclusive zones. These may be situated within Active areas are they are
processed first and if small may actually save processing time by preventing
full analysis of the image.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'><b>Units</b> - This setting
which details whether certain of the following settings are in Pixels or
Percent, where Percent refers to a percentage area of the zone itself. In
general Pixels is more precise whereas percentages are easier to use to start
with or if you change image sizes frequently. If you change this setting all
appropriate values below are redisplayed in the correct context. A good tip
would be to initially enter the settings in Percent and then change to Pixels
and refine any gaps. Repeated flipping between the settings will cause rounding
errors, as ZoneMinder in general is not at home to Mr Floating Point for
reasons of performance. Note, the sense of the percentage values changed in
version 1.19.0. Prior to that percentages referred to the area of the image as
a whole, whereas it now only refers to the area of the zone. This makes trying
to work out necessary sizes rather easier.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'><b>Min/Maximum X/Y</b> -
Following the units the next four settings define the bounds of the Zone in the
monitor frame and are self-explanatory with the exception of the fact that the
minima are at the top left of the frame and the maxima are at the bottom right
rather than in a Cartesian style.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'><b>Alarm Colour </b>- The
option after that allows you to specify what colour you'd like any alarms this
zone generates to be highlighted on images, pick anything you like that will
show up against your normal image background. This option is irrelevant for
Preclusive and Inactive zones and will be disabled For Inactive zones all
subsequent options are likewise disabled.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'><b>Alarm Check Method </b>This
is a new addition to Zone definitions. It allows you to specify the nature of
the alarm checking that will take place, and more specifically what tests are
applied to determine whether a frame represents an alarm or not. The three
options are AlarmPixels, FilteredPixels and Blobs and depending on which option
is chosen some of the following other settings may become unavailable. The
first of these indicates that only a count of individual alarmed pixels should
be used to determine the state of a image, the second indicate that the pixels
should be filtered to remove isolated pixels (see below) before being counted,
and the third uses a more sophisticated analysis which is designed to aggregate
alarmed pixels into continuous groups, or blobs. Blob analysis is the method
ZoneMinder has always used previously (before it became optional) and so this
is the default. However this method takes slightly longer and so if you find
that one of the other methods works just as well for you and you wish to
maximise performance you can opt for that instead. Some of the more useful
alarm related features such as highlighted analysis images are only available
with the Blob setting.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'><b>Min/Maximum Pixel Threshold</b>
 These setting are used to define limits for the difference in value between a
pixel and its predecessor in the reference image. For greyscale images this is
simple but for colour images the colours are averaged first, originally this
used an RMS (root mean squared) algorithm but calculating square roots mugs
performance and does not seem to improve detection. Using an average does means
that subtle colour changes without any brightness change may go undetected but
this is not the normal circumstance. There is also the option to use a more
sophisticated integer algorithm to calculate a Y (or brightness) value from the
colours themselves.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'><b>Min/Maximum Alarmed Area</b>
- The following two settings define the minimum and maximum number of pixels
that exceed this threshold that would cause an alarm. If the units are Percent
this (and following options) refers to the percentage of the frame and not the
zone, this is so these values can be related between zones. The minimum value
must be matched or exceeded for an alarm to be generated whereas the maximum
must not be exceeded or the alarm will be cancelled. This is to allow for sudden
changes such as lights coming on etc, which you may wish to disregard. In
general a value of zero for any of these settings causes that value to be
ignored, so you can safely set a maximum to zero and it will not be used. The
use of just a number of pixels is however a very brute force method of
detection as many small events dispersed widely are not distinguished from a
compact one.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'><b>Filter Width/Height</b> 
To improve detection of valid event ZoneMinder applies several other functions
to the data to improve its ability to distinguish interesting signals from
uninteresting noise. The first of these is a filter that removes any pixels
that do not participate in a contiguous block of pixels above a certain size.
These options are always expressed in pixels and should be fairly small, and an
odd number, three or five is a good value to choose initially. Application of
this filter removes any tiny or discontinuous pixels that don't form part of a
discrete block. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'><b>Min/Maximum Filtered Area</b>
 These are two additional bounds that specify the limits of pixels that would
cause an alarm after this filtering process. As the filtering process can only
remove alarmed pixels it makes no sense for the Minimum and Maximum Filtered
Area to be larger than the equivalent Alarmed Area and in general they should
be smaller or the same.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'><b>Min/Maximum Blob Area</b> -
The next step in the analysis phase is the collation of any remaining alarmed
areas into contiguous blobs. This process parses the image and forms any pixels
that adjoin other alarmed pixels into one or more larger blobs. These blobs may
be any shape and can be as large as the zone itself or as small as the filtered
size. The Minimum and Maximum Blob Size settings allow you to define limits
within which an alarm will be generated. Of these only the Minimum is likely to
be very useful.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:27.0pt'><b>Min/Maximum Blobs </b>-
Finally the Minimum and Maximum Blobs settings specify the limits of the actual
number of blobs detected. If an image change satisfies all these requirements
it starts or continues an alarm event.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc104622501"><span style='text-decoration:none'>6.3.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Viewing
Monitors</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As this point you should have one or more Monitors
running with one or more Zones each. Returning to the main Console window you
will see your monitors listed once more. The columns not explored so far are
the Monitor name, and various event totals for certain periods of time.
Clicking on any of the event totals will bring up a variation on the same
window but click on the Monitor name for now. On doing so up will pop another
window which should be scaled to contain a heading, an image from your monitor,
a status and a list of recent events if any have been generated. Depending on
whether you are able to view a streamed image or not the image frame will
either be this stream or a series of stills. You have the option to change from
one to the other (if available) at the centre of the top heading. Also along
the top are a handful of other links. These let you change the scale of the
image stream, modify image settings (for local devices) or close the window. If
you have cameras that can be controlled, a Control link should also be preset
which is described below.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The image should be self-explanatory but if it looks like
garbage it is possible that the video configuration is wrong so look in your
system error log and check for or report anything unusual. The centre of the
window will have a tiny frame that just contains a status; this will be 'Idle',
'Alarm' or 'Alert' depending on the function of the Monitor and what's going on
in the field of view. Idle means nothing is happening, Alarm means there is an
alarm in progress and Alert means that an alarm has happened and the monitor is
cooling down, if another alarm is generated in this time it will just become
part of the same event. These indicators are colour coded in green, red and
amber.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>By default if you have minimised this window or opened
other windows in front it will pop up to the front if it goes to Alarm state.
This behaviour can be turned off in options if required. You can also specify
a sound file in the configuration, which will be played when an alarm occurs to
alert you to the fact if you are not in front of your computer. This should be
a short sound of only a couple of seconds ideally. Note that as the status is
refreshed every few seconds it is possible for this not to alert you to every
event that takes place, so you shouldn't rely on it for this purpose if you
expect very brief events. Alternatively you can decrease the refresh interval
for this window in the configuration though having too frequent refreshing may
impact on performance.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Below the status is a list of recent events that have
occurred, by default this  is a listing of just the last 10 but clicking on
'All' will give you a full list  and 'Archive' will take you to the event
archive for this monitor, more on this  later. Clicking on any of the column
headings will sort the events appropriately.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>From here you can also delete events if you wish. The
events themselves are listed with the event id, and event name (which you can
change), the time that the event occurred, the length of the event including
any preamble and postamble frames, the number of frames comprising the event
with the number that actually contain an alarm in brackets and finally a score.
This column lists the average score per alarm frame as well as the maximum
score that any alarm frame had.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The score is an arbitrary value that essentially
represents the percentage of pixels in the zone that are in blobs divided by
the square root of the number of blobs and then divided by the size of the
zone. This gives a nominal maximum of 100 for a zone and the totals for each
zone are added together, Active zones scores are added unchanged, Inclusive
zones are halved first and Exclusive zones are doubled. In reality values are
likely to be much less than 100 but it does give a simple indication of how
major the event was.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc104622502"><span style='text-decoration:none'>6.4.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Controlling
Monitors</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>If you have defined your system as having controllable
monitors and you are looking at a monitor that is configured for control, then
clicking on the Control link along the top of the window will change the
short event listing area to a control area. The capabilities you have defined
earlier determine exactly what is displayed in this window. Generally you will
have a Pan/Tilt control area along with one or subsidiary areas such as zoom or
focus control to the side. If you have preset support then these will be near
the bottom of the window. The normal method of controlling the monitor is by
clicking on the appropriate graphics which then send a command via the control
script to the camera itself. This may sometimes take a noticeable delay before
the camera responds.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>It is usually the case that the control arrows are
sensitive to where you click on them. If you have a camera that allows
different speeds to be used for panning or zooming etc then clicking near the
point of the arrow will invoke the faster speed whilst clicking near the base
of the arrow will be slower. If you have defined continuous motion then ongoing
activities can be stopped by clicking on the area between the arrows, which
will either be a graphic in the case of pan/tilt controls or a word in the case
of zoom and focus controls etc. Certain control capabilities such as mapped
motion allow direct control by clicking on the image itself when used in
browsers which support streamed images directly. Used in this way you can just
click on the area of the image that interests you and the camera will centre on
that spot. You can also use direct image control for relative motion when the
area of the image you click on defines the direction and the distance away from
the centre of the image determines the speed. As it is not always very easy to
estimate direction near the centre of the image, the active area does not start
until a short distance away from the centre, resulting in a dead zone in the
middle of the image.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc104622503"><span style='text-decoration:none'>6.5.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Filtering
Events</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The other columns on the main console window contain
various event totals for your monitors over the last hour, day, week and month
as well as a grand total and a total for events that you may have archived for
safekeeping. Clicking on one of these totals or on the 'All' or 'Archive' links
from the monitor window described above will present you with a new display.
This is the full event window and contains a list of events selected according
to a filter which will also pop up in its own window. Thus if you clicked on a
'day' total the filter will indicate that this is the period for which events
are being filtered. The event listing window contains a similar listing to the
recent events in the monitor window. The primary differences are that the
frames and alarm frames and the score and maximum score are now broken out into
their own columns, all of which can be sorted by clicking on the heading. Also
this window will not refresh automatically, rather only on request. Other than
that, you can choose to view events here or delete them as before.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The other window that appeared is a filter window. You
can use this window to create your own filters or to modify existing ones. You
can even save your favourite filters to re-use at a future date. Filtering
itself is fairly simple; you first choose how many expressions you'd like your
filter to contain. Changing this value will cause the window to redraw with a
corresponding row for each expression. You then select what you want to filter
on and how the expressions relate by choosing whether they are 'and' or 'or'
relationships. For filters comprised of many expressions you will also get the
option to bracket parts of the filter to ensure you can express it as desired.
Then if you like choose how you want your results sorted and whether you want
to limit the amount of events displayed.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>There are several different elements to an event that you
can filter on, some of which require further explanation. These are as follows,
'Date/Time' which must evaluate to a date and a time together, 'Date' and
'Time' which are variants which may only contain the relevant subsets of this,
'Weekday' which as expected is a day of the week. All of the preceding elements
take a very flexible free format of dates and time based on the PHP strtotime
function (http://www.zend.com/manual/function.strtotime.php). This allows
values such as 'last Wednesday' etc to be entered. I recommend acquainting
yourself with this function to see what the allowed formats are. However
automated filters are run in perl and so are parsed by the Date::Manip package.
Not all date formats are available in both so if you are saved your filter to
do automatic deletions or other tasks you should make sure that the date and
time format you use is compatible with both methods. The safest type of format
to use is -3 day or similar with easily parseable numbers and units are in
English.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The other elements you can filter on are all fairly self
explanatory except perhaps for 'Archived' which you can use to include or
exclude Archived events. In general you'll probably do most filtering on
un-archived events. There are also two elements, Disk Blocks and Disk Percent
which dont directly relate to the events themselves but to the disk partition
on which the events are stored. These allow you to specify an amount of disk
usage either in blocks or in percentage as returned by the df command. They
relate to the amount of disk space used and not the amount left free. Once your
filter is specified, clicking 'submit' will filter the events according to your
specification. As the disk based elements are not event related directly if you
create a filter and include the term DiskPercent &gt; 95 then if your current
disk usage is over that amount when you submit the filter then all events will
be listed whereas if it is less then none at all will. As such the disk related
terms will tend to be used mostly for automatic filters (see below). If you have
created a filter you want to keep, you can name it and save it by clicking
'Save'.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>If you do this then the subsequent dialog will also allow
you specify whether you want this filter automatically applied in order to
delete events or upload events via ftp to another server and mail notifications
of events to one or more email accounts. In most cases you can specify your
preferences for upload formats and email content during configuration time
(make sure you type '?' to get help on options). Emails and messages
(essentially small emails intended for mobile phones or pagers) have a variety
of tokens that can be substituted for various details of the event that caused
them. This includes links to the event view or the filter as well as the option
of attaching images or videos to the email itself. See the included templates
zmconfig_eml.txt and zmconfig_msg.txt for a fuller explanation of the
availability and meaning of these tokens. Finally you can also specify a script
which is run on each matched event. This script should be readable and
executable by your web server user. It will get run once per event and the
relative path to the directory containing the event in question. Normally this
will be of the form &lt;MonitorName&gt;/&lt;EventId&gt; so from this path you
can derive both the monitor name and event id and perform any action you wish. Note
that arbitrary commands are not allowed to be specified in the filter, for security
the only thing it may contain is the full path to an executable. What that
contains is entirely up to you however.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Filtering is a powerful mechanism you can use to
eliminate events that fit a certain pattern however in many cases modifying the
zone settings will better address this. Where it really comes into its own is
generally in applying time filters, so for instance events that happen during
weekdays or at certain times of the day are highlighted, uploaded or deleted.
Additionally using disk related terms in your filters means you can
automatically create filters that delete the oldest events when your disk gets
full. Be warned however that if you use this strategy then you should limit the
returned results to the amount of events you want deleted in each pass until
the disk usage is at an acceptable level. If you do not do this then the first
pass when the disk usage is high will match, and then delete, all events unless
you have used other criteria inside of limits. ZoneMinder ships with a sample
filter already installed, though disabled. The PurgeWhenFull filter can be used
to delete the oldest events when your disk starts filling up. To use it you
should select and load it in the filter interface, modify it to your
requirements, and then save it making you sure you check the Delete Matching
Events option. This will then run in the background and ensure that your disk
does not fill up with events.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc104622504"><span style='text-decoration:none'>6.6.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Viewing
Events</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>From the monitor or filtered events listing you can now
click on an event to view it in more detail. If you have streaming capability
you will see a series of images that make up the event. You will also see a
link to allow you to view the still images themselves. If you don't have
streaming then you will be taken directly to this page. The images themselves
are thumbnail size and depending on the configuration and bandwidth you have chosen
will either be the full images scaled in your browser of actual scaled images.
If it is the latter, if you have low bandwidth for example, it may take a few
seconds to generate the images. If thumbnail images are required to be
generated, they will be kept and not re-generated in future. Once the images
appear you can mouse over them to get the image sequence number and the image
score.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>You will notice for the first time that alarm images now
contain an overlay outlining the blobs that represent the alarmed area. This
outline is in the colour defined for that zone and lets you see what it was
that caused the alarm. Clicking on one of the thumbnails will take you to a
full size window where you can see the image in all its detail and scroll
through the various images that make up the event. If you have the
ZM_RECORD_EVENT_STATS option on, you will be able to click the 'Stats' link
here and get some analysis of the cause of the event. Should you determine that
you don't wish to keep the event, clicking on Delete will erase it from the
database and file system. Returning to the event window, other options here are
renaming the event to something more meaningful, refreshing the window to
replay the event stream, deleting the event, switching between streamed and
still versions of the event (if supported) and generating an MPEG video of the
event (if supported).</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>These last two options require further explanation.
Archiving an event means that it is kept to one side and not displayed in the
normal event listings unless you specifically ask to view the archived events.
This is useful for keeping events that you think may be important or just wish
to protect. Once an event is archived it can be deleted or unarchived but you
cannot accidentally delete it when viewing normal unarchived events.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The final option of generating an MPEG video is still
somewhat experimental and its usefulness may vary. It can use either the
Berkeley MPEG encoder or the faster and new ffmpeg encoder. Either of these
will generate a short video, which will be downloaded to your browsing machine
to view. Due to the relatively slow frame rate that ZoneMinder will capture at
and the high minimum frame rate that the Berkeley encoder uses videos created
by this method will be very quick. However when using the ffmpeg encoder,
ZoneMinder will attempt to match the duration of the video with the duration of
the event. This has the useful effect of making the video watchable and not too
quick while having the unfortunate side effect of increasing file size and
generation time. Ffmpeg in particular has a particularly rich set of options
and you can specify during configuration which additional options you may wish
to include to suit your preferences. In particular you may need to specify
additional, or different, options if you are creating videos of events with
particularly slow frame rates as some codecs only support certain ranges of
frame rates. Details of these options can be found in the documentation for the
encoders and is outside the scope of this document.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Building an MPEG video, especially for a large event, can
take some time and should not be undertaken lightly as the effect on your host
box of many CPU intensive encoders will not be good. However once a video has
been created for an event it will be kept so subsequent viewing will not incur
the generation overhead. Videos can also be included in notification emails,
however care should be taken when using this option as for many frequent events
the penalty in CPU and disk space can quickly mount up.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc104622505"><span style='text-decoration:none'>6.7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Options
and Users</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The final area covered by the tutorial is the options and
user section. If you are running in authenticated mode and dont have system
privileges then you will not see this section at all and if you are running in
un-authenticated mode then no user section will be displayed.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The various options you can specify are displayed in a
tabbed dialog with each group of options displayed under a different heading.
Each option is displayed with its name, a short description and the current value.
You can also click on the ? link following each description to get a fuller
explanation about each option. This is the same as you would get from
zmconfig.pl. A number of option groups have a master option near the top which
enables or disables the whole group so you should be aware of the state of this
before modifying options and expecting them to make any difference.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>If you have changed the value of an option you should
then save it. A number of the option groups will then prompt you to let you
know that the option(s) you have changed will require a system restart. This is
not done automatically in case you will be changing many values in the same
session, however once you have made all of your changes you should restart
ZoneMinder as soon as possible. The reason for this is that web and some
scripts will pick up the new changes immediately but some of the daemons will
still be using the old values and this can lead to data inconsistency or loss.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>One of the options you may notice in the System tab
allows you to specify the default language for your installation of ZoneMinder.
Versions 1.17.0 and later support multiple languages but rely on users to
assist in creating language files for specific languages. To specify a language
you will have to give the applicable code, thus for UK English this is en_gb,
and for US English it would be en_us, if no language is given then UK English
is assumed. Most languages will be specified in this nn_mm format and to check
which languages are available look for files named zm_lang_*.php in the
ZoneMinder build directory where the parts represented by the * would be what
you would enter as a language. This is slightly unwieldy and will probably be
improved in future to make it easier to determine language availability. On
checking which languages are available it may be that your preferred language
is not currently included and if this is the case please consider doing a
translation and sending it back to it may be included in future releases. All
the language elements are given in the zm_lang_en_gb.php file along with a few
notes to help you understand the format.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As mentioned above, you may also see a users tab in the
Options area. In this section you will see a list of the current users defined
on the system. You can also add or delete users from here. It is recommended
you do not delete the admin user unless you have created another fully
privileged user to take over the same role. Each user is defined with a name
and password (which is hidden) as well as an enabled setting which you can use
to temporarily enable or disable users, for example a guest user for limited
time access. As well as that there is a language setting that allows you to
define user specific languages. Setting a language here that is different than
the system language will mean that when that user logs in they will have the
web interface presented in their own language rather than the system default,
if it is available. Specifying a language here is done in the same way as for
the system default language described above.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>There are also four values that define the user
permissions, these are stream, events, monitors and system Each can
have values of none, view or edit apart from stream which has no edit
setting. These values cover access to the following areas; stream defines
whether a user is allowed to view the live video feeds coming from the
cameras. You may wish to allow a user to view historical events only in which
case this setting should be none. The events setting determines whether a
user can view and modify or delete any retained historical events. The
monitors setting specifies whether a user can see the current monitor
settings and change them. Finally the system setting determines whether a
user can view or modify the system settings as a whole, such as options and
users or controlling the running of the system as a whole. As well as these
settings there is also a monitor ids setting that can be used for non-system
users to restrict them to only being able to access streams, events or monitors
for the given monitors ids as a comma separated list with no spaces. If a user
with monitors edit privileges is limited to specific monitors here they will
not be able to add or delete monitors but only change the details of those they
have access to. If a user has system privileges then the monitors ids
setting is ignored and has no effect.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Thats pretty much is it for the tour, though there is a
lot more to ZoneMinder as you will discover. You should experiment with the
various setting to get the results you think are right for your requirements.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc104622506"><span style='text-decoration:none'>7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Camera
Control</a></h1>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Version 1.21.0 of ZoneMinder introduced a new feature,
allowing you to control cameras from the web interface and to some extent
automatically. Pan/Tilt/Zoom (PTZ) cameras have a wide range of capabilities
and use a large number of different protocols making any kind of generic
control solution potentially very difficult. To address this ZoneMinder uses
two key approaches to get around this problem.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span class=name1><b>1) Definition of Capabilities</b></span><span
class=name1> </span> <span class=name1>For each camera model you use, an entry
in the camera capabilities table must be created. These indicate what functions
the camera supports and ensure that the interface presents only those
capabilities that the camera supports. There are a very large number of
capabilities that may be supported and it is very important that the entries in
this table reflect the actual abilities of the camera. A small number of
example capabilities are included in ZoneMinder, these can be used as is or
modified.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span class=name1><b>2) Control Scripts</b></span> 
ZoneMinder itself does not generally provide the ability to send commands to
cameras or receive responses. What it does is mediate motion requests from the
web interface into a standard set of commands which are passed to a script
defined in the control capability. Example scripts are provided in ZoneMinder
which support a number of serial or network protocols but it is likely that for
many cameras new scripts will have to be created. These can be modelled on the
example ones, or if control commands already exist from other applications,
then the script can just act as a glue layer between ZoneMinder and those
commands.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='color:black'>It should be emphasised that
the control and capability elements of ZoneMinder are not intended to be able
to support every camera out of the box. Some degree of development is likely to
be required for many cameras. This should often be a relatively straightforward
task however if you have a camera that you want to be supported then please feel
free to get in touch and I should be able to provide an estimate for how much
effort this is likely to be. It is also the case that I have only been able to
access this limited number of cameras to test against; some other cameras may
use different motion paradigms that dont fit into the control
capability/script architecture that ZoneMinder uses. If you come across any
cameras like this then please forward as much information to me as possible so
that I may be able to extend the ZoneMinder model to encompass them.</span></p>

Capabilities</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='color:black'>If you have a camera that
supports PTZ controls and wish to use it with ZoneMinder then the first thing
you need to do is ensure that it has an accurate entry in the capabilities
table. To do this you need to go to the Control tab of the Monitor
configuration dialog and select Edit where it is listed by the Control Type
selection box. This will bring up a new window which lists, with a brief
summary, the existing capabilities. To edit an existing capability to modify
select the Id or Name of the capability in question, or click on the Add button
to add a new control capability. Either of these approaches will create a new
window, in familiar style, with tabs along the top and forms fields below. In
the case of the capabilities table there are a large number of settings and
tabs, the mean and use of these are briefly explained below.</span></p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Control Scripts</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText><span style='color:black'>The second key element to
controlling cameras with ZoneMinder is ensuring that an appropriate control
script or application is present. A small number of sample scripts are included
with ZoneMinder and can be used directly or as the basis for development.
Control scripts are run atomically, that is to say that one requested action
from the web interface results in one execution of the script and no state
information is maintained. If your protocol requires state information to be
preserved then you should ensure that your scripts do this as ZoneMinder has no
concept of the state of the camera in control terms.</span></p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>If you are writing a new control script then you need to
ensure that it supports the parameters that ZoneMinder will pass to it. If you
already have scripts or applications that control your cameras, the ZoneMinder
control script will just act as glue to convert the parameters passed into a
form that your existing application understands. If you are writing a script to
support a new protocol then you will need to convert the parameters passed into
the script to equivalent protocol commands. If you have carefully defined your
control capabilities above then you should only expect commands that correspond
to those capabilities.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The standard set of parameters passed to control scripts
is defined below,</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:
3.0pt;margin-left:1.0cm'><b><span style='color:black'>--device=&lt;device&gt; </span></b>

</span></b> This is the control address from the monitor definition. This will
usually be a hostname or ip address for network cameras or a simple numeric
camera id for other cameras.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-top:0cm;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

Devices</a></h1>

<p class=MsoPlainText>ZoneMinder has always had a minimal WML (Wireless Markup
Language) capability to allow it to function on mobile phones and similar
devices. However as of 1.20.0 this is now deprecated and has been replaced with
a new XHTML  Mobile Profile mode as well as the default HTML4. XHTML-MP is a
small, and limited, version of XHTML intended for mobile devices and is based
on XHTML Basic. It does not contain scripting or other dynamic elements and
essentially is a subset of HTML as most people know it.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The ZoneMinder XHTML-MP interface allows you to log into
your installation via your phone or mobile devices and perform a limited number
of tasks. These include viewing recent events, and monitoring live streams. However
unlike the full interfaces these elements are presented as still images
requiring manual refreshing. For now the XHTML-MP interface is presented as a
prototype interface; rather than one offering full capabilities. As such,
please feel free to make comments or offer suggestions via the forums on <a
href="http://www.zoneminder.com/">http://www.zoneminder.com</a>. One final word
on mobile mark-up standards in general and their application to ZoneMinder.
Ideally Id like to offer a WML2.0 interface. WML2.0 is a blending of WML1.3,
which is traditional WAP, and XHTML. As such it offers the scripting that WML
has traditionally included plus the better control of markup that is the realm
of XHTML. Unfortunately so far Im unaware of any devices that support WML2.0,
certainly Ive never had a phone that does. If you find out that a particular
phone does support this then please let me know (or better still send me the
phone!).</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>If you wish to use the XHTML-MP interface to ZoneMinder
there is no extra configuration required to enable it per se. However
ZoneMinder needs to be able to figure out what kind of content to deliver to
particular browsers, so you have two choices. You can either edit zm.php and
include a definition that corresponds to your phone describing a small number
of basic capabilities, you will see a couple of examples already there, or you
can use the comprehensive open source WURFL package available from <a
href="http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/">http://wurfl.sourceforge.net/</a>. You
will need to download both the WURFL php files and the wurfl.xml file itself.
WURFL is a resource containing information on the capabilities of a huge number
of mobile phones, devices and browsers. Thus once it has matched your phone it
can determine various capabilities it may possess. This means that ZoneMinder
itself only has to deal with these capabilities and not the individual phone
types.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>To use WURFL you should install the php files in the same
directory as ZoneMinder and then create a wurfl sub-directory and ensure it
is readable and writeable (or preferably owned by) your web server user. You
should put the wurfl.xml file in there. One other thing you may need to change,
as the xml file is quite large, is the memory_limit setting in php.ini as the
default setting of 8Mb may be too small. Once youve done this you should find
that your phone or device is recognised and if it can support XHTML-MP it will
receive that interface. If your phone is very new, or you are using an old
version of the XML file you might find that it is not present however. The
WURFL library uses a caching strategy to avoid reloading the whole XML file
each time so check if a sensible looking cache file has been created in the wurfl
sub-directory also check the wurfl.log in the same place.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>The WURFL is a third party application and as such I am
unable to offer support directly for it. If you feel your device is missing or
incorrectly represented please contact the authors via their own channels. If
on the other hand you have any comments on ZoneMinder on your device
specifically please let me know and I would be pleased to hear about it.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>As support for cookies in mobile devices is patchy at
best, the groups feature is not fully implemented in the XHTML-MP views.
Instead if there is a group called Mobile already defined then that group
will always be effective, if not then all monitors available to the logged in
user will be visible,</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Life eh? Nothing ever works first time does it? In case
you are having problems here are some things to try. If these don't work then
check the ZoneMinder FAQ at <a href="http://www.zoneminder.com/faq.html">http://www.zoneminder.com/faq.html</a>
and then the forums at <a href="http://www.zoneminder.com/forums">http://www.zoneminder.com/forums.html</a>
first and see if anyone has had the same problem in the past. If not then feel
free to get in touch and I'll see if I can suggest something else. . Please
ensure that you read the posting guidelines and go through the steps listed
below before posting or mailing though. The best places to look for errors are
in the system error log (normally /var/log/messages on RedHat), the ZoneMinder
logs, and the web server log (/var/log/httpd/error_log unless otherwise
defined). There should be something in one of those that gives you some kind of
tip off.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Some things to check first.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Device configuration. If you can't get your cameras to work in
ZoneMinder, firstly make sure that you have the correct settings. Use xawtv or
something like that to check for settings that work and then run zmu -d
&lt;device_no&gt; -q -v to get the settings. If you can't get them to work with
that then the likelihood is they won't work with ZoneMinder. Also check the system
logs (usually /var/log/messages) for any video configuration errors. If you get
some and you're sure they're not a problem then switch off
ZM_STRICT_VIDEO_CONFIG in zmconfig.pl or the options tab.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Start simple. Begin with a single monitor and single zone. You
can run the zmc capture daemon from the command line as 'zmc --device 0' (or
whatever your video device is). If it returns immediately there's a problem so
check the logs, if it stays up then your video configuration is probably ok. To
get more information out of it use debug as specified below. Also check that
the shared memory segment has been created by doing 'ipcs -m'. Finally, beware
of doing tests as root and then trying to run as another user as some files may
not be accessible. If you're checking things as root make sure that you clean
up afterwards!</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Web server. Ensure that your web server can serve PHP files. It's
also possible that your php.ini file may have some settings which break
ZoneMinder, I'm not a PHP guru but setting safe mode may prevent your PHP files
from running certain programs. You may have to set configuration to allow this.
Also since the daemons are started by your web server, if it dies or is shut
down then the daemons may disappear. In this version the daemons are run under the
control of a script which should trap expected signals but it is possible this
doesn't cover all circumstances. If everything else works but you cant get
images in your browser a likely cause is a mismatch between where your web
server expects to execute CGI scripts and where you have installed the zms
streaming server. Check your server configuration for the correct CGI location
and ensure you have supplied the same directory to the ZoneMinder configure
script via the with-cgidir option. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>One of the more common errors you can see in the log files is of
the form 'Can't shmget: Invalid argument'. Generally speaking this is caused by
an attempt to allocate an amount of shared memory greater than your system can
handle. The size it requests is base on the following formula, ring buffer size
x image width x image height x 3 (for 24 bits images) + a bit of overhead. So
if for instance you were using 24bit 640x480 then this would come to about 92Mb
if you are using the default buffer size of 100. If this is too large then you
can either reduce the image or buffer sizes or increase the maximum amount of
shared memory available. If you are using RedHat then you can get details on
how to change these settings at <a
href="http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/database/RHDB-2.1-Manual/admin_user/kernel-resources.html">http://www.redhat.com/docs/manuals/database/RHDB-2.1-Manual/admin_user/kernel-resources.html</a>.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>You should be able to use a similar procedure with other
distributions to modify the shared memory pool without kernel recompilations
though in some cases this may be necessary. You can also sometimes get shared
memory errors if you have changed the monitor image size for instance. In this
case it is sometimes that an old process is hanging onto the shared memory and
will not let it be resized. Ensure that you do a full ZoneMinder restart and/or
manually delete the shared memory segment to check. Use the ipcs and ipcrm
system commands to check and remove segments if necessary.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>If you get odd javascript errors and your web console or other
screens come up with bits missing then it's possible that there is a problem
with the PHP configuration. Since version 0.9.8 ZoneMinder has used short PHP
open tags to output information, so instead of something like this '&lt;?php
echo $value ?&gt;', it will be something like this '&lt;?= $value ?&gt;' which
is easier and quicker to write as well as being neater. More information about
this directive can be seen at the following location, <span class=MsoHyperlink>http://www.php.<a
name="_Hlt42867874">n</a>et/manual/en/configuration.directives.php#ini.short-open-tag</span>.
However although by default most PHP installations support this form, some will
need to have it switched on explicitly. To do this you will first need to find
your php.ini file (do a 'locate php.ini' or 'find / -name php.ini'. Be aware
however that sometimes you might find more than one, so ensure you identify the
one that is actually being used. You will then need to find the line that
starts 'short_open_tag = ' and change the Off value to On. This will correct
the problem. However in some cases you may have explicitly switched it off, so
that XML compliant documents can be more easily served, or you may even not
have permission to edit the file. In this case you can go into the web
directory of ZoneMinder and run 'sh retag.sh' which will replace all the short
open tags in the files themselves with the longer variant. You will obviously
have to remember to do this for each subsequent version of ZoneMinder that you
install as well.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Use debug. ZoneMinder has various debug in it that by default
will go into your system log (via syslog). These will be of the form of</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'>&quot;Sep 14 14:50:11
localhost zma-0[1975]: INF [Front: 221000 - Processing at 4.26 fps ]&quot;</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'>where the zma-0 part
identifies the daemon and the device it is running on. Entries with INF in are
informational and not an error, if you see ERR then it is one, though not all
are fatal. WAR would indicate a warning. You can prevent this information from
being emitted by setting the ZM_DBG_LEVEL_zmc environment variable to -1 or
less once things are working. If you want to run any of the daemons from the
command line to test, setting ZM_DBG_PRINT to 1 will output the debug on the
console. You can also use the USR1 and USR2 signals to increase or decrease the
amount of debug being emitted.</p>

</span></span>Paths. I admit it, the various paths in ZoneMinder can be bit of
a nightmare mainly because some relate to real directories and others to web
paths. Make sure that they are all correct and that permissions are such that
the various parts of ZoneMinder can actually run.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><i><span

the various scripts. If you get errors about missing ones, the easiest way to
install them is to type the following (you will probably need to be root),</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt'>this will then (eventually,
after some configuration if its your first time) present you with a prompt.
From there you can type install module, e.g. Archive::Zip and the rest should
be more or less automatic as it will chase any dependencies for you. There may
be some initial configuration questions it might ask you on startup if you've
never run it before and to speed things up I would not install a new Bundle at
this point (it can end up building you a whole new perl if youre not careful)
if it asks you but everything else should be quite straightforward. You can
often also install perl modules via your ordinary package manager, e.g. yum or
apt.</p>

</span></span>Unsupported palettes. ZoneMinder currently is designed to use the
simple palettes of greyscale and 24 bit as well as now the YUV420P and some
other palettes. This should cover most cameras but it's possible that there are
ones out there that might want to use more esoteric formats that ZoneMinder
doesnt support. This will often show up as the capture daemon being unable to
set picture attributes. If this occurs try using different palettes starting
with greyscale and if you can't get anything to work let me know and I'll try
and add it.</p>

</span></span>USB bus problems. If you have multiple USB cameras on one bus
then it can appear as if ZoneMinder is causing your cameras to fail. This is
because the bandwidth available to cameras is limited by the fairly low USB
speed. In order to use more than one USB camera with ZoneMinder (or any
application) you will need to inform the driver that there are other cameras
requiring bandwidth. This is usually done with a simple module option. Examples
are usb_alt=&lt;n&gt; for the OV511 driver and cams=&lt;n&gt; for CPIA etc.
Check your driver documentation for more details. Be aware however that sharing
cameras in this way on one bus will also limit the capture rate due to the
reduced bandwidth.</p>

</span></span>Incorrect libjpeg.a detection. It seems to be the case that in
some cases the library file libjpeg.a is reported as missing even when
apparently present. This appears to actually be down to the g++ compiler not
being installed on the host system. Since ZoneMinder contains both C++ and C
files you need to be able to compile both of these file types and so usually
need to ensure you have gcc and g++ installed (though they are often the same
binary).</p>

</span></span>Httpd and zms memory leaks. It has been reported by some users
with RedHat 9 that the zms process fails to terminate correctly when the
controlled window is killed and also that it, and its associated httpd
process, continue to grow in memory size until they kill the system. This
appears to be a bug in early versions of  apache 2. On other systems it may
appear that zms is leaking and growing. However what grows is the total and
shared memory size while the non-shared memory size stays constant. It's a
little odd but I think what it happening is that as zms picks images out of the
shared memory ring buffer to display, as each slot is read the size of that bit
of memory is added to the shared memory total for the process. As streamed
images are not read consecutively it's a semi-random process so initially most
of the buffer slots are new and the shared memory size grows then as time goes
on the remaining unaccessed slots reduce until once all have been read the
shared memory use caps out at the same size as the actual segment. This is what
I would have expected it to be in the first place, but it seems to do it
incrementally. Then once this total is hit it grows no further. As it's shared
memory anyway and already in use this apparent leak is not consuming any more
memory than when it started.</p>

Cambozola that causes image corruption in the stream. If you are getting this
then I suggest you stick with version 0.22 which is available from the
Downloads section of <a href="http://www.zoneminder.com/">www.zoneminder.com</a>.
You can also switch between using zms or nph-zms the latter of which supplies
non-parsed headers which should work somewhat better.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Also, if you are using IE under Windows and get lots of

as mirrored. Thus images can now be flipped horizontally or vertically before
processing as well as rotated as in previous versions.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  Made the Options link only appear if the user has
sufficient permissions.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  Fixed issue where the PTZ control function to set camera
presets never passed the preset number so preset 1 was always used.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  A custom title can now be added via the normal Options
dialog (ZM_WEB_TITLE_PREFIX). This title will be used in all browser windows
and allows you to distinguish between multiple ZM installations for example.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Ordinarily ZoneMinder will resize the console window to
fit the number of monitors displayed. If you are using a tabbed browser this
can be a little irritating. A new option (ZM_WEB_RESIZE_CONSOLE) has been added
to control this behaviour.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Version 1.21.0 added support for events to be labelled
with Cause and Notes fields. However these could not be modified directly from
the web interface. This has been amended so that an Edit link is now present
in the events listing. Clicking on this allows you to modify these fields for
one or more events so they can be identified as belonging to a particular
incident.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  There has long been a dichotomy between the functions
that can be applied via interactive filters versus background saved filters.
This release addresses this to some extent allowing you, for instance, to
archive or unarchive matching events, or edit them as described above. This is
not a complete solution and it is expected that the functionality will converge
further in the future.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Previously in the c/c++ code accessor functions had to
be called to access the value of configuration options. This was expensive when
done repeatedly so some classes used cached local variables to avoid this. The
configuration has been rewritten to provide all configuration options as
members of the configuration class which are initialised once on startup and
then can be accessed directly with no further overhead.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>LANGUAGE  Support for the Danish language has now been included.
Thanks for forum user voronwe for his work on this. Select dk_dk in the
languages preferences to use this language.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Events viewed in the events listing view can now be
saved locally by clicking on the Export button. This creates a tar or zip
file of the selected file groups, such as images, videos etc, as well as,
optional, HTML pages describing the basic details about the event and frame
details. This allows a basic navigation and viewing of the events outside of
the regular ZoneMinder interface. This format is different, and improved, over
that that created in the background filter function and it is expected that
these functions will converge at some point.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  Clearing the Track Motion checkbox in the Control section
of the Monitor configuration would not be saved resulting in this setting being
stuck in an on state. This has been corrected.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  The Play All link in the event view allows a sequence of
events to be streamed consecutively. This is fine in a streamed view but
meaningless in the stills view so has been removed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  The show trigger command in zmtrigger.pl has been
added to allow miscellaneous externally sourced text to be displayed in the
image timestamps.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Add the Auto Stop Timeout monitor control option to
allow finer control of Pan/Tilt/Zoom cameras with support for only basic
continuous modes of motion.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>LANGUAGE  The German language files have been updated.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Support for control of Axis network cameras has been
added. This uses the zmcontrol-axis-v2.pl script and should work with all Axis
PTZ network cameras that use version 2 of the Axis API.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  The zmaudit.pl script has been modified to be faster
and access disk a lot less. Previously it was possible for this script to
frequently thrash disks while determining timestamps on directories.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  A contributed patch by Ross Melin has been included.
This gives you the option of using an alternative mailing method in the
zmfilter.pl script if the default method does not work correctly. To use the
new method go to Options-&gt;Email and set ZM_NEW_MAIL_MODULES to on.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  Previously the ZM_EMAIL_HOST config was not passed to the
zmfilter.pl script so hosts other than localhost were not used. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>LANGUAGE  A translation for the Romanian language has been
added. To use it select ro_ro as the language.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  In previous versions the path to the zms daemon from web
pages was in the form of a local web path without hostname. This has been
reported as not working with certain media players where the hostname is not
implied, as with browsers. The paths to the streaming server now always have
the hostname prepended so that they are always a full valid url.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  Monitors that are inactive no longer have an active link
for streaming as this has no real purpose.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  An experimental Pelco-P control script has been added
to support PTZ cameras that support this protocol. This script has not really
been tested but is included as a basis for further development or
customisation.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  The zmfilter.pl script now respects the ZM_FAST_DELETE
option and will fully delete any events rather than assuming that zmaudit.pl
will clear up if it just removes the primary database record.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  The montage view layout now correctly utilises the
ZM_MAX_MONTAGE_COLS option when determining the dimensions and layout of the
montage window.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  A contributed patch by forum user lazyleopard has
been included. This allows a specified number of frames to be discarded to
alleviate problems with broken interlaced frames where multiple cameras share
one bttv chip and produce a comb edge like image. To invoke this option go to
Options-&gt;Config and set ZM_CAPTURES_PER_FRAME to greater than 1, a value of
3 is recommended in the first instance.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Several users have reported problems using the Perl
Compatible Regular Expression (PCRE) library, mostly to do with it not being
found or an incorrect version being used. This version allows an alternative
method of parsing the output from network cameras that does not depend on
libpcre at all. Which method is used is controlled by the option Options-&gt;Network-&gt;ZM_NETCAM_REGEXPS.
If this option is on then the traditional regular expression based parsing is
implemented, provided you have built with libpcre. If the option is off or
libpcre is missing then a more basic parsing is used instead. This new method
should be slightly faster as it does not have the overhead of regular
expression parsing, however this also makes it slightly more inflexible. If you
experience problems using the new method with your netcam then you should try
switching to the regular expression based method, and report the issue via the
forums, preferably with a snapshot of the output of your camera.</p>

</span></span>FIX  The montage view layout has been modified to allow better
dynamic layout of windows. Views should now be laid out in a more logical
arrangement. This is a relatively temporary change and the montage view will
shortly be rewritten to use flowing div tags which should add more
flexibility and be less complex. </p>

1.20.1</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Mostly bug fixes, large and small with a couple of minor
features included.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  A dependency on the regular expression library was
introduced in 1.20.0 which caused some people to have build problems. This
library has traditionally been is necessary to support network cameras but not
otherwise. This situation has now been restored. </p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span class=postbody><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span class=postbody>FEATURE </span> <span
class=postbody>Added ZM_RAND_STREAM option. This option adds a time code onto the
url of each stream to prevent it from being cached which had caused some broken
image problems with some browsers, notably Mozilla.</span></p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span class=postbody><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span></span><span class=postbody>FIX </span> <span class=postbody>Made
zms check ZM_OPT_AUTH before loading user details. This should have been in
there in 1.20.0 but was omitted and should fix the issue where streams did not
work with authentication off.</span></p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span class=postbody><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Release
1.20.0</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Improved and added features, several minor bug fixes.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Certain configuration (Mostly database settings) is now
stored in a new file zm.conf. This means that database access settings can be
changed without recompilation. It also allows the creation of ZoneMinder rpms.
Watch zoneminder.com for details. Thanks for forum user oskin for his work on
this.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

monitors to be viewed independently.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  A generic external triggering interface has been
included via the zmtrigger.pl script. A new monitor function Nodect has been
added to support this.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Interaction between the web pages and the streaming
daemons and other utilities has previously been not as secure as it could have
been and open to possible abuse. This has now been addressed and zms and zmu
both now use (optional) authentication strings to validate access. You need to
have openssl installed so that the MD5 libraries can be linked. See the
ZM_AUTH_METHOD and ZM_AUTH_SECRET configuration items for further details.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  The maximum daemon restart delay in zmdc.pl was
previously fixed at 15 minutes. This may have been too long for some users, for
example if power has failed to a camera then a 15 minute delay on restoration
is not desirable. This maximum is now configurable via the ZM_MAX_RESTART_DELAY
configuration item.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  The web files have been changed to use the newer style
autoglobals, e.g. $_SERVER rather than $HTTP_SERVER_VARS. This should enable
use on PHP5 without any modification.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  The use of two database users has been somewhat redundant
for a number of versions now. In 1.20.0 there is only one database user. The
zmupdate.pl script unfortunately cannot handle the migration as it needs to
access the database so you should make a note of the username and password of
the privileged user and then re-enter that using zmconfig.pl when rebuilding
ZM.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  The zmupdate.pl script previously held a database
connection open for days at a time but only used to use it periodically. This
has now been changed to be only open while in use.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

in the monitor watch window. This has been corrected.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

more or less than three significant digits were used. This has been corrected.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  Image capture timeouts used by zmwatch.pl to restart
apparently frozen zmc processes were being calculated incorrectly on occasion.
This was causing some unnecessary processes to be restarted. This calculation
has been fixed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  Complete DOCTYPE headers were added to HTML output and some
HTML was tidied up to be more compliant.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  There was a problem with the interaction between monitor
statuses and the status web window. This meant that sometimes the window did
not pop to the front, or play the alarm sound, properly. This has been
corrected.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  Some network cameras send data in a format which was
previously not recognised by the regular expression engine. This has been
modified to allow these cameras (NC1000 etc) to function with ZoneMinder.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=MsoPlainText>Various miscellaneous fixes and features.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

device serial port if enabled.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span

changed to include further information about the cause.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>LANGUAGE  Fixed missing semicolon in German language file.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Added &lt;&lt; and &gt;&gt;  links to the page
selector in the events list as suggested by forum user <span class=name1>unclerichy</span><span
class=name1><b><span style='font-size:8.5pt;font-family:Verdana'>.</span></b></span></p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Brightness, colour, hue and contrast are now saved
persistently for a monitor rather than being reset each time the system is
restarted. This feature is based on a patch submitted by forum user oskin.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  In previous versions the events folder has been keyed
by the monitor name. This has caused problems in the past with various
characters appearing which are legal in names but not in filesystems. From this
version all files related to monitors are keyed on the monitor id rather than
the name. To help you navigate through these files the monitor name still
exists but as a link only. Please ensure you run zmupdate.pl to update your
events directory.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  You may now optionally have thumbnail images in your
event lists. To enable this functionality set ZM_WEB_LIST_THUMBS on in
Options-&gt;Web. You can also control the width or height of these thumbnails
but should only set one dimension only and leave the other blank or zero.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  You can now specify how many image thumbnails appear
across and down the page in the event stills listing. In Options-&gt;Web set
the ZM_WEB_FRAMES_PER_LINE and/or ZM_WEB_FRAME_LINES options.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  ZoneMinder uses ffmpeg (<a
href="http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/">http://ffmpeg.sourceforge.net/</a>) for
video generation and processing. Recently a new version (0.4.9-pre1) was
released which changed the interface that ZoneMinder uses and so broke
compilation. This version will detect which version of ffmpeg you have and
compile accordingly.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  You can now specify a prefix for events generated by
particular monitors. This will replace the default Event- one.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  If you use filters to send event notification emails
you can now have them sent in HTML format. This is done automatically if your
mail body includes a &lt;html&gt; token,</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  An experimental feature has been added which lets you
view several events in sequence. In event listing you can check the events you
want to view and then click the View button. This will allow you to navigate
through only those events in the normal manner (via Prev and Next links) but
also to view them in sequence by clicking on the Play All link. This will
replay each event and then automatically move onto the next one. You can stop
this progression at any time by pressing Stop (which only stops the sequence
and not the currently playing event). The timing of the replay is done
depending on the calculated length of the event (plus one second) and so may
not exactly correspond to the real event length. In particular this is unlikely
to work if replaying events using MPEG video and buffering players as the
timing will likely be incorrect. If you are viewing an event but havent
checked any in the list the Play All button will just work down the current
event list.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  A default php error level excluding notice warnings is now
explicitly set.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Previously events have been created even if only one
frame has generated an alarm. This has not always been desirable as sometimes
glitches and flickers create large numbers of events, however no mechanism
existed for limiting this. In this version you can now specify the minimum
number of consecutive alarmed frames that are necessary to create an event.
This is the Alarm Frame Count described above. Note that if an alarm is in
progress single isolated alarmed frames will still prolong it and the count
only applies to the initial frames that would cause the event.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Language fixes and updates.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  The US English language file was recursively including

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

<h2><a name="_Toc104622518"><span style='text-decoration:none'>10.7.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Release
1.19.3</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Minor tweaks, fixes and language updates.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  All stills views now use the single image mode of zms
rather than spawning off a zmu process to write an image which is then read.
This reduces complexity of double buffering significantly and also reduces the
chance of errors caused by multiple simultaneous image generation.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  The generated MIME types when creating streamed video
were previously assigned by zms depending on which of a limited number of
output formats was specified. This has now been changed so that the ffmpeg
libavformat library itself now generates these identifiers. The consequence of
this is that many more video formats supported by your version of ffmpeg should
now be available via zms.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  When viewing a single frame of an event you can select
a stats link to view the statistics that apply to that frame, if you have the
RECORD_EVENT_STATS option switched on. This can be used to help configure your
zones for optimal motion detection. Previously only pixel count values were
displayed here which made it difficult to configure zones configured in
percentage terms. These values are now displayed in both pixel and percentage
terms to assist in zone configuration. Note that the percentage values are
based on the current size of the zone so if this is changed then the value
displayed will not be applicable at the time of event generation.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  When doing motion detection an extra blob, that could never
be removed, was sometimes included. This could have caused false triggering and
has not been corrected.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  A problem was reported whereby when using bulk frame
records to reduce database load the last frame record was not written.
Replaying the event via the web interface resulting in the event being
truncated. A correction has been made so prevent this and ensure that the last
frame of an event is always recorded.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  If an analysis daemon terminates abnormally or the host
computer crashes then events can be left in a state whereby they effectively
have zero length and are useless. A change to zmaudit.pl was made such that any
open events such as this which have not been updated for at least five
minutes are closed and updated to reflect their actual content so that they may
be viewed or saved. Events recovered in this way are named with a (r) mark to
help identify them.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  In more recent versions of MySQL the password hash
generated is 50 characters long, which overflows the previous password field in
the database which was only 32 characters long. This field has been extended to
64 characters to accommodate this.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  The montage view had an error whereby the refresh timeout
for stills was mislabelled causing continuous refresh attempts which rendered
the view mostly unusable. The constants in question are now correctly
referenced.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  The default, bandwidth specific, rate and scales were not
always used as the records in the database were misnamed. This is now corrected
though you may need to reset the values that were used previously as these will
be lost if they had been changed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  It was previously the case that old images could be left in
the images directory for a long period, sometimes resulting in incorrectly
assuming correct operation. A fix was made to zmaudit.pl which modified the
previous clean up of old WAP images so that any old images left in this
directory are removed after a short period. Please ensure that if you have
customised the web interface and have images you wish to keep that they are not
left in the temporary images folder as they will now be deleted.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

identified and fixed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>LANGUAGE  A Brazilian Portuguese translation has been supplied

<h2><a name="_Toc104622519"><span style='text-decoration:none'>10.8.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Release
1.19.2</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Minor features, fixes and language updates.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  The default replay rate and live and event scale
settings are now configurable on a per bandwidth basis rather than globally.
This allows you to view at full scale when you have high bandwidth and at
smaller scales when you do not have so much resource. You will need to
re-configure your previous defaults as they will be lost.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Filters can now include a specification of the
preferred sort order of the results.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Filters can now include a specification to limit the
results to a predefined maximum</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Two new filter elements have been added. These are disk
blocks and disk percentage. These are event independent and return the amount
of disk space used on the event partition in terms of disk blocks or percentage
as returned by <i>df(1)</i>. Thus filters using these criteria will either
match all events or none at all depending on the disk usage at the time of
filter execution. The addition of these terms along with the ability to sort
and limit filter results now means it is possible to create a filter that will
automatically clear out old events once disk usage exceeds a certain value.
Included in the database schemas for both new installations and upgrades is a
sample filter called PurgeWhenFull which can be used to do this. It is
initially not set to do anything automatically so if you want to use it, you
should load it into the filter selection window, modify it to your taste and
then save it, selecting auto delete. Please note that filters created using
disk related terms to delete events should always contain a limit term also
otherwise it is possible for all events to match and thus be deleted. Using a
limit ensures that only a small number are affected at any one time.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FEATURE  Filters can now be defined to automatically execute an
external script or program of your choosing. This can be specified when the
filter is saved. Note that for security reasons this cannot be just any
arbitrary command but must be readable and executable by your web server
effective user. The script or program you specify here will be executed in the
events root directory once for each event and will be passed one parameter
containing the relative path to the event directory. This will normally be of
the form <i>&lt;MonitorName&gt;/&lt;EventId&gt;</i> so it it possible to
determine both the monitor and event in question from the path. Note also that
a flag is set per event as with other auto actions indicating that an
executable script has been run on that event and so to exclude it from
subsequent matches. However if you have several filters all with executable
scripts you will find that only the first gets executed as the flag will be set
following successful completion and so no further scripts will be run on that
event. Successful completion is indicated by the script returning a zero exit
status, any other status indicates an error and the <i>executed </i>flag will
not be set.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  In some circumstances temporary diagnostic images were
being saved instead of highlighted analysis images. This is now corrected.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  When viewing a list of frames in an event, the link to the
diagnostic image was incorrect. This is now fixed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  The <i>Archive </i>link from the monitor watch window has
been fixed. Previously this generated a bogus window.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  The zone definition have been updated so that selecting the
various types of zones etc only disables those options you no longer have
access to rather than wiping them out entirely. This is also true of the zone
when saved. Thus you can now more easily change a zone to be temporarily
inactive for example and have your previous active settings restored in the
future.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FIX  Selecting an event from the list generated by a filter that
included a Monitor Name term did not previously work properly. This is now
fixed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span>LANGUAGE  An additional Italian language translation has been
added. One, by Davide Morelli, was included in 1.19.1 but not announced.
However like buses another one has come along, from Tolmino Muccitelli, and so
they are both now present. The original translation is accessible by selecting <i>it_it</i>
as the language whereas the new one is <i>it_it2</i>. I would prefer if they
were merged as two versions of one language is not easy to maintain when I
dont know what the differences mean!</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Release
1.19.0</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Some major enhancements and bugfixes.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>MPEG video streaming. ZoneMinder now supports true video
streaming if configured with the <i>with-ffmpeg</i> option. This allows one or
both of live or event streaming to be in this format rather than motion JPEG
style as before. Note however that is still somewhat experimental and may not
work on your system. The reason for this is due to the variation in plugins and
video movie formats. Currently I have got it working well with browsers on
Windows platforms using the Windows Media Player plugin and the 'asf' video
format. I have also managed to get event streaming working on Mozilla using
mplayer (I think) though it jumps in and out of it's place in the window a bit.
I would appreciate any feedback or advice on formats and plugins that work on
your system. Also note that video streaming tends to get buffered before being
displayed. This can result in the 'live' view being several seconds delayed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Motion JPEG Capture. Previously image capture from network
devices has been limited to single stills capture only. This has now changed
and if you entered a remote camera path that returns the <i>multipart/x-mixed-replace</i>
MIME type then this will be parsed and images extracted from the stream. This
is much faster than before and frame rates can be as fast now with network
cameras as with capture cards and video. This feature also has the side-effect
that one ZoneMinder installation can use another as a remote video source.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>NPH Streaming. After months of frustration I have finally figured
out why streams were corrupted using Cambozola versions after 0.22. It turned
out that apache was injecting characters into the streams which was screwing up
the headers. I believe this to be because the initial header had no
content-length header, as the length is indeterminate. So I have added a zero
content length header which I believe fixes the problem though perhaps not in
the best way. I have also made the installation link the existing zms binary to
nph-zms so that you can now use zms in non-parsed-header mode. If it detects it
is in this mode then the content-length header is not output, though several
other additional ones are. In nph mode the false character injection seems to
disappear so I suspect this is a better way to use zms.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Bulk Frame Records. With the recent advent of the 'Record' and
'Mocord' modes a lot of people have started using ZoneMinder as a pseudo-DVR.
This meant that a lot of database activity was taking place as each captured
frame required its own entry in the database. The frames table has now been
reorganised so that 'bulk' frames may be written at defined intervals to reduce
this database activity. The records act as markers and individual frame timings
are interpolated in between. Bulk frames are only used when no alarm or motion
detection activity is taking place and normal frame records are kept otherwise.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Event List Ordering and Scrolling. It was previously the case
that the Next and Prev buttons on the event view did not always go to the
event that was expected and sometimes disappeared altogether. This behaviour
has now been modified and these buttons will now take you to the next and
previous events in the list which the event was selected from. Thus if the list
was sorted on ascending scores then the next event is the one below which has
a higher score etc. A possibly counterintuitive side effect of this is that as
the default list is sorted by descending time the next event is the one below
in the list which will actually be earlier and the previous event is later.
So long as you remember that next and prev refer to the order of the list you
should be ok.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Zone Percentage Sizes. Zone motion detection parameters can be
defined either in terms of total pixels or as a percentage. This percentage was
defined relative to the size of the image as a whole. However this was
difficult to calculate or estimate especially with several zones of varying
sizes. In version 1.19.0 this has been changed so that the percentage relates
to the size of the zone itself instead. This should make calculations somewhat
easier. To convert your existing zones you can run zmupdate.pl with the z
option, though this should be done only once and you should backup your
database beforehand in case of error.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Console View System Display. The console display was slight
revamped to indicate disk space usage (via the df command) on the events
partition,</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Zone Form Validation. Changes applied in version 1.18.0 to
prevent invalidate entries in the zone definition form actually had the
opposite effect due to JavaScript treating everything as a string and not a
number (e.g. 5 is greater than 123). This is now corrected.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Default Rate and Scales. You can now specify (in the options
dialog) the default scale you would like to view live and event feeds at. You
can also give a default rate for viewing event replays.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>More Rates. Additional faster rates have been included, up to 100
times.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Frame Buffer Size. Previously it was possible for frames being
sent from the analysis daemon to the frame server to exceed the defined maximum
buffer size in which case the write would fail. It is now possible to define a
larger size if necessary to prevent this. Note that you may have to adjust your
system configuration to accommodate this. For further details check the help
for the ZM_FRAME_SOCKET_SIZE option.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Filter Name Duplication. Following recent changes to the filters
table, several people reported that when saving filters they actually got a
duplicate. This resulted in several copies of filters all with the same name as
the constraint on unique filter names was not present. Well it is now so when
upgrading your database all the filters will be renamed from myfilter to
myfilter_&lt;id&gt; where &lt;id&gt; is the id number in the database
(which is then removed). In general the higher the id number the more recent
the filter. So you should go through your filter list deleting old copies and
then rename the last one back to its original name.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Filter Form. Problem were reported with the filtering form where
several selections generated SQL errors. This is now fixed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Filter Image Attachments. A fix was made to zmfilter.pl to
prevent it trying to attaché alarm images to non-alarm events.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Video Rate Specification. A fix was made to zmvideo.pl that
corrected a problem with no default frame being used if none was passed in.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>RBG-&gt;BGR Black Screen. Fixed an issue with black screens being
reported in RGB24 mode if RGB-&gt;BGR invert was not selected.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span

1.18.0 please note that now as part of the upgrade process all your filters
will have any automatic actions unset. This is because the previous affinity to
a particular monitor has now been removed and you may be left with several
filters all doing the same thing to all of the events or have filters which for
instance delete events on only one monitor but which now would delete them for
all of them. It is recommended that you review your list of saved filters and
delete duplicates before adding any monitor specific terms and resetting the
actions for any that remain.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc104622523"><span style='text-decoration:none'>10.12.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Release
1.18.0</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Major optimisations, important new features and some
bugfixes.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Optimisations and Performance Improvements. This release contains
several major performance improvements in various areas. The first of these is
that image processing for YUV style input formats are now pretty much handled
at almost the same speed as native RGB formats. As this is what the capture
daemons spend most of their time doing, the improvement helps reduce the amount
of CPU time by a significant degree. Application of these changes also
highlighted a bug that had existed previously in YUV conversion which caused
incorrect conversions for certain values. The other two main areas of
optimisation are in the Blend and Delta image functions. Normally when doing
motion detection the analysis daemons spend about 99% of their time comparing a
captured image with the reference image and then blending the two ready for the
next capture. Both of these functions have been significantly improved. In
previous versions there were two options for calculating image deltas (or
differences), a simple RGB average and a Y channel calculation. Historically
the RGB one was faster however with the optimisations the Y channel calculation
(which is more accurate) is now 15-20% faster and so has become the default
though you can select either method by the ZM_Y_IMAGE_DELTAS configuration
option. A new method of image blending has also been added which is up to 6
times faster than the old one which is retained for compatibility and because
in some unusual circumstances it may still be more accurate (see the ZM_FAST_IMAGE_BLENDS
option for details). Altogether these optimisations (along with other common
sense ones such as not maintaining a reference image in Record mode where it
is not used) significantly reduce the CPU load for most systems, especially
when alarms are not in progress. If an alarm is detected then a lot of file
system and database activity takes place which is limited by the speed of these
resources so the gain will not be as much.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Remote Authentication. This document has previously indicated that
basic authentication for network cameras could be used by entering a hostname
of the form of &lt;user&gt;:&lt;pass&gt;@&lt;hostname&gt;. This was not
actually the case as the relevant authentication header was never sent. This is
now fixed and addresses of this form can now be used.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Filter Date Parsing. The zmfilter.pl date parsing now correctly
reports when dates or times which it cannot parse are used.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Monitor Independent Filters. Previously filters were closely tied
to a monitor and a new filter had to be created for each monitor. This has now
changed and filters can now specify an associated monitor in the same was as
other parameters. Links have now been added to the main console view to allow
you to view lists of events from all monitors in one and saved filters can now
affected as many or as few monitors as you wish. IMPORTANT: Please note that as
part of the upgrade process all your filters will have any automatic actions
unset. This is because the previous affinity to a particular monitor has now
been removed and you may be left with several filters all doing the same thing
to all of the events or have filters which for instance delete events on only
one monitor but which now would delete them for all of them. It is recommended
that you review your list of saved filters and delete duplicates before adding
any monitor specific terms and resetting the actions for any that remain.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>New Filter Operators. Two new filter operators and their inverse
have been added. You can now indicate whether a value is in a set of other values,
for example cat is in the set of cat, dog, cow, horse. You can also use
regular expressions so cat matches ^c.*. The not in set and not matches
operators are also available.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Additional Scales. Enhancements to the scaling algorithm mean that
non binary scales are now just as easy to apply, thus new scales such as 0.75x
have been added. Others can be easily included if necessary.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Montage Sizing. The montage view allows you to view all of your
active cameras in one window. However if your cameras are different sizes then
this becomes very untidy. You can now constrain the image size of each monitor
in this view to a fixed size with the ZM_WEB_MONTAGE_WIDTH and
ZM_WEB_MONTAGE_HEIGHT configuration options. Monitor images will be enlarged or
reduced as necessary.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Compact Montage. The traditional montage view includes individual
small menus for each monitor and a status display. This results in a somewhat
cluttered display and the refreshing of the status displays may generate more
accesses than desirable. Using the ZM_WEB_COMPACT_MONTAGE configuration option
allows this montage view to only include the monitor streams and one overall
menu bar with no status displays.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Monitor Name Constraint. The name given to a monitor is used in
file paths and several other areas. Thus it is important that it follows
certain conventions but up until this release these names were unrestricted.
The monitor form now limits monitor names to alphanumeric characters plus
hyphen and underscore.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Timestamp Change. Traditionally ZoneMinder has time-stamped each
image as it is captured. This ensures that all images have their capture time
recorded immediately. However there are several side-effects which may be
undesirable. Firstly the time and resource is spent time-stamping images that
are not recorded and which are discarded, secondly the timestamp is included in
any motion detection and may potentially trigger an alarm if detection
parameters are very sensitive. The third effect is that as the timestamp is
added to the image at its native resolution, if the image is scaled then the
timestamp is scaled also. This may not be a problem for enlargement but if the
image size is reduced then it may become illegible. This version now allows
you, via the ZM_TIMESTAMP_ON_CAPTURE configuration option, to indicate whether
the timestamps should be added on capture, as before, or only added when the
image is viewed or recorded. Setting it to this later value allows timestamps
to be added to scaled images. This is little performance impact either way.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Scaleable Stills View. The stills view of a monitor (when
streaming is not available or desired) is now scaleable in the same way as the
streamed view.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Double Buffered Stills View. The stills view has now been
restructured to allow a double buffering approach. Thus a new image is loaded
in the background and only written to screen when complete. This removes the
refresh flicker that means that the screen blanks periodically however uses
more JavaScript so may not be suitable for all platforms. Whether ZoneMinder
uses double buffering or not is controlled by the ZM_WEB_DOUBLE_BUFFER
configuration option.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fixed Length Event Bug. A bug was reported whereby the fixed
length events that could be specified for use in Record or Mocord mode could
sometimes result in events a multiple of that length. So events that were meant
to be 15 minutes long could sometimes be 30 or even 45 minutes. This was
especially the case with monitors that had low frame rates. This is now fixed.</p>

</span></span>Strsignal Function. The strsignal function was included from
version 1.17.1 however this is not ubiquitous on all distributions. The
existence of this function is now tested for by the configure script and it is
not used if not present.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Add Max Alarm Threshold. Previously the alarm threshold (which is
the amount a pixel has to differ from its counterpart in the reference image)
existed only in a minimum form meaning pixels that were more different
matched. A maximum has now been added to assist in screening out large changes
in brightness. In addition to this a number of new consistency checks have been
added to the zone definition form to try and prevent bogus or invalid settings.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Diagnostic Zone Images. A regularly requested feature is that of
adding extra information to allow diagnostics of the process of image
detection. This has previously been somewhat hit and miss but in this version a
new configuration option ZM_RECORD_DIAG_IMAGES has been included to allow this.
This option will generate several images for each captured frame in an alarm
including each reference image and a series of images containing the image
differences at various stages in the process. It is not possible to record
these for the image prior to an alarm but those following it are included and
should assist in tuning the zones to provide optimal motion detection.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Event Images Renamed. The capture and analysis images recorded
during an event have been renamed from capture-???.jpg to ???-capture, and from
analyse-???.jpg to ???-analyse.jpg. This is to allow all images (including
diagnostic ones) to be associated with the frame sequence number more easily.
This means that old events will no longer be able to be viewed as the wrong
image will be being searched for. To avoid this you can use the new
zmupdate.pl utility to rename all your old images by doing perl zmupdate.pl
r as an appropriately privileged or root user.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Version checking. ZoneMinder will now optionally check for new
versions of itself at zoneminder.com. This is done with a simple http get and
no personal information otherwise than your current version of ZoneMinder is
transmitted or recorded. If new versions are found you may be alerted of them
via the web interface. This is an initial step towards enhancing and automating
the upgrade process.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Force Java. Previously ZoneMinder could be forced to override
its detection of browser capabilities to prevent the Cambozola Java applet
being used. However sometimes the opposite effect was desired and using the
applet was preferred to native image handling. This has now been made possible
by making the ZM_CAN_STREAM option tri-state allowing auto, yes or no to
be used to provide all alternatives.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span

</span></span>Alarms Cleared on Exit. In previous versions if an alarm was
present when the analysis daemon (zma) exited the alarm would remain flagged.
This had little effect except if the monitor was being watched however it was a
bit annoying so any alarm flag is now cleared when this daemon exits.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Login Bug. A bug was identified whereby an unauthorised user
could gain access to the console view of ZoneMinder. This was the only view
available and no access to any camera views or configuration was possible. This
bug is now fixed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>New Languages. Two new language files were added. These allow
ZoneMinder to use the German (de_de) and Polish (pl_pl) languages.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Language File Format. The format of the language file was changed
to allow the specification of character set and locale as well as have more
flexibility in the calculation of plural forms.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Option Language. The prompts and help text for the options is now
also available for translation. A guide is included in the language file to
allow this if necessary. Currently language translations exclude the options
settings as this is a rarely accessed area and contains a great deal of text.
The new format allows individual options to be translated piecemeal as the
opportunity arises.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc104622526"><span style='text-decoration:none'>10.15.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Release
1.17.0</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Language changes and other enhancements.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Version Numbering. ZoneMinder version numbers have now changed.
This is to allow more frequent point releases which are expected to happen
for instance whenever new language files are included. Previously all releases
had the same version increment so it was difficult to tell the significance of
any particular release. Now the version number is in the <i>x.y.z</i> format
where a change in <i>x</i> signifies a major fundamental or architectural
rework, a change in <i>y</i> will indicate a new release containing incremental
feature changes or fixes recommend to all users and a change in <i>z </i>will
generally mean minor non-functional or critical modifications which would not
be recommended as important to all users. As ZoneMinder has been referred to by
the point release up until now, e.g. .15, .16 etc the next number in that
sequence has been retained for continuity and to avoid having any ambiguity in
version numbers.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Language Support. ZoneMinder now allows specification of system
and user specific languages other than UK English. These languages are given in
language files named zm_lang_<i>nn_mm</i>.php which can be created from the
default zm_lang_en_gb.php file. If your language is not included then please
consider doing a translation by checking this file and submitting your changes
back for inclusion in future releases.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Syntactic Improvements. Previously setting NOTICE errors on in
PHP would flag tens or hundreds of violations in the ZoneMinder web files.
Whilst not strictly errors this represented sloppy coding and sometimes covered
up genuine bugs. All the files have been revisited and revised to ensure that a
many of these problems as possible have been eliminated and only the very few where
the fix would be significantly less optimal than the problem remain.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Stream Scaling Resizing. Previously when watching a stream and
modifying the scale of the streamed feed only the actual feed would change size
and the containing frames and windows would remain the same. This was fine for
changes to smaller scales but problematic for larger scales. This has been
changed for that the window and frames will now resize appropriately.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Mmap Return Value. A problem identified by users in the forum
relating to checking of return values from the mmap function call has been
corrected.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Minor Bugs. A number of minor bugs and inconsistencies were
corrected.</p>

<h2><a name="_Toc104622527"><span style='text-decoration:none'>10.16.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Release
0.9.16</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Major usability enhancement and fixes.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Run States. Instead of the old start/stop links the current
system state is now a link which takes you to a dialog which allows you to
start, restart or stop the system. You can also save the current run state
which basically takes a snapshot of the current monitor functions and saves
that. You can then reselect that state later which basically involves resetting
the monitors to have these saved functions and then doing a system restart.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>New Monitor Functions. Instead of Passive, Active, and X10, the
modes are now Monitor (= old Passive) which just allows you to watch the feed,
Modect (= old Active) which is MOtion DetECT and which will capture events as
previously, Record which continuously records with no analysis and MoCord which
is a hybrid of Modect and Record and which will continuously record but also do
motion detection and highlight where this has occurred. The Record and Mocord
functions both records events whose length in seconds is defined by the
'Section Length' monitor attribute. You can additionally specify a 'Frame Skip'
value to tell it to not record 'n' frames at a time, when not alarmed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>X10 Function removed. The X10 mode has been removed and replaced
by an indication of whether the monitor is 'continuous' or 'triggered'. This
basically just indicates whether it may be controlled outside of zmdc and
zmpkg. Additionally the X10 triggers may now be specified in an X10 section.
This has changed to allow for other types of triggers to be added more easily.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Paginated Event listings. The event listings are paginated by
default. You can list all of the events if you like by choosing the appropriate
option. There are shortcuts to pages of events at the top of the listing. If
these produce strange looking sequences like 1,2, 3, 5, 9, 17, 37 etc this is
deliberate and uses an exponential algorithm intended to allow you to quickly
navigate through the list to a particular page in the minimum number of clicks.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Scaleable Streams. Event and monitor streams can now be scaled to
a certain extent allowing you to view at a different resolution than that
captured. This area may be somewhat incomplete especially in terms of
monitoring at a higher screen size where the frame is not adjusted properly.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Variable Frame Rates. Event streams can now be viewed at various
rates allowing faster review (if your bandwidth allows) to long events, or
slower for more precision.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Scaleable/Variable MPEG generation. Generation of MPEG videos now
also allows you to specify the scale relative to the original image and also
the frame rate. Again, for long events captured in the perpetual recording
modes this will allow a faster review of the period the event covers.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tabbed Monitor options. Specification and modification of
monitors is now in a tabbed form for easier navigation.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Additional stream headers. The stream headers have been changed
to hopefully ensure that they are less likely to be cached.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Maximum process restart delay. zmdc.pl now has an upper limit (15
minutes) to the time it waits before restarting continuously crashing
processes.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Intelligent Module inclusion. zmfilter.pl now includes
Archive::Zip and other modules on an as needed basis so won't complain about
them being missing unless they have been explicitly configured to be used.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Adaptive Watchdog. zmwatch now more adaptive to actual frame
rates.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fixed zmfilter CPU sucking bug. zmfilter.pl will now restart on
failure to read shared memory. Previously this could go into a nasty CPU
sucking loop!</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>New zmconfig options. zmconfig.pl has a new option to run with no
database if necessary</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>File reorganisation. Various administrative file changes and
reorganisations.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Compiler warnings. Various tweaks and modifications to reduce
compiler and memory warnings.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>SQL Buffer size. Increased SQL buffer size to cope with large
pre-event buffers, plus a couple of other buffers have been enlarged.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Incorrect Frame time offsets. The time offsets in alarmed frames
were incorrect and based on the time of storage rather than capture. This gave
the impression that there was a delay after the first alarmed frame and messed
up some streaming timings. This has been fixed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Event Frame listing. You can now view details of the frames
captured such as their time and score etc by clicking on the scores in the
events views.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Refined shared memory handling. Fixed zmfilter, zmwatch and zmx10
to allow zero as a valid shared memory id to allow them to keep on working if
the segment has been marked for deletion</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Frame daemon stability. Changed image buffer in zmf to be static
rather than dynamic. This has made zmf much more stable.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>MPEG overwrite option. Fixed the 'Overwrite' checkbox in video
generation to actually overwrite the video. Modded the page slightly also.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Daemon control improved. Changing between monitor functions, e.g.
Modect, Mocord etc now restarts the correct daemons.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Improved time based filters. Filters that include time based
clauses now get executed regardless of whether new events are being generated.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Audit daemon started unconditionally. zmaudit is now started
regardless of the setting of FAST_DELETES as zmfilter depends on it being
there.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Filtering more active. zmfilter is now started in 'Monitor' mode.
It does not run in when monitors are completely off however.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Stills paged. The stills view of events is now paginated for
easier navigation.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Archive images optional. Normally when an alarm is detected a set
of raw images is saved along with a mirror set of images containing motion
highlighting. This second set can now optionally be disabled.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Settings in auth mode. Control of camera brightness, contrast etc
did not previously work when running in authorised mode. This is now fixed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>zms parameter bug fixed. The streaming server incorrectly parsed
and assigned one of its arguments. This is now fixed.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>zmu brighness bug. Previously camera brightness was not correctly
parsed from command line options passed to zmu.</p>

<p class=BullettedChar><span style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Event window width variable. Event windows now scale to fit the
event image size.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Release
0.9.15</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Various bug fixes from the last release and before.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Bandwidth. A bug was introduced in .14 which caused a corrupted
console display and manic refreshes on new installations. This was due to a
missing bandwidth setting when no existing cookie was detected. This is now
fixed.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Again in .14 a problem occurred for a new release whereby
zmconfig wanted to know the database details and but also previously wanted to
access the database before it had asked the questions. This has now been
addressed though it does require that zmconfig is run twice initially, once to
created the scripts and once to import the configuration into the database.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>In association with the previous error, the zm_config_defines.h
file was not created in the absence of the database as this was what was used
to assign configuration ids. This now takes place regardless of the database.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The SQL to create the Users table was mistakenly omitted from the
.12 database upgrade script this has now been corrected.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A bug in zmfilter was pointed out whereby the dynamic loading of
the Zip or Tar archive modules depending on a preference actually wasnt. It
was looking for both and loading both at compile time. This has now been
modified to be fully runtime.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The database user definitions in the zmvideo script indicated one
database user while the database connection used a different one. This
prevented any videos being generated.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>A problem was found if using the zmf frame server and greyscale
images. The option to colourise JPEG images is intended to be used to ensure
that all JPEG files are written with a 24 bit colourspace as certain tools such
as ffmpeg require this. However in the circumstances described above images
written by zma directly were colourised whereas those written by  zmf werent.
A change has been made whereby if set all greyscale JPEG images are colourised
in all circumstances.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Major new feature and important bug-fixes.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Web configuration. Following many requests and to make ZoneMinder
easier to administer the configuration system has been changed slightly. You
should now still run zmconfig.pl to specify an initial configuration but you
now only need to answer the first few questions to give a core set of options
including the database options. The remainder of configuration options can then
be ignored to start with and all but the core options will be written to the
database. You can then view and modify these options from the web interface and
apply then without recompilation, which is now only necessary if you change the
core configuration.</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Y channel bug. When using colour cameras a motion detection
problem was present if fast RGB images deltas (ZM_FAST_RGB_DIFFS) was off. This
was an overflow error in the calculation of the Y channel and caused excessive
image differences to be calculated. This has now been fixed.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>The use of the Term::Readkey perl module in zmaudit.pl has been
removed. This module had been removed from zmconfig.pl previously but had
lingered in this script.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Removed use of zmu binary from zmwatch.pl and zmx10.pl.
Previously these scripts had used zmu to determine last image time and alarm
state information. The use of this script was a bit overkill and the
introduction of user permissions complicated matter slightly so these scripts
now access the shared memory directly.</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Shared memory permissions. Following introduction of a user
permissions system the previous 777 mode for shared memory was deemed insecure.
Consequently from now on shared memory is only accessible from the owner. This
means that zmu will only work when run as root or the web user unless you set
it setuid where it should still be secure as it will require authentication.</p>

from the Settings link on the monitor window. It's fairly basic at present but
should work for most types of cameras. If you have any device or driver
specific auto-brightness, auto-contrast etc enabled the changes you make may
appear to work but may be overridden by the auto feature immediately so check
for that if your changes do not appear to be having an effect. Also if you have
a number of cameras being multiplexed onto one device then any changes here
will probably affect all your cameras.</p>

will be one users already defined, with username 'admin' and password 'admin'.
This user is defined will full permissions and clicking on the 'Options' link
from the main console window will allow you to modify and create users with
various permission sets which hopefully will satisfy most requirements. These
users (except any defined with 'system' edit capability) can be restricted to
certain cameras by adding the monitor ids as a comma-separated list (no spaces)
to the appropriate field. Users limited to specific monitors may not create or
delete monitors even if defined with monitor edit permissions.</p>

</span></span>Some windows now (optionally) use a JavaScript timeout to refresh
themselves rather than a refresh header. Since refresh headers were interrupted
if a link of the page was linked there were previously various forced refreshes
from child windows to restart the refresh process. By using JS refresh timers
which are not interrupted these extraneous refreshes have been mostly
eliminated.</p>

style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>Release
0.9.12</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Mostly bug-fixes with a couple of minor features.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Double first images. Fixed a problem where the first image of an
event was being recorded twice. I dont think this was at the cost of any of
the other images but one copy was an extra.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Made zmdc connect more intelligent. On the suggestion of a couple
of people I have made the zmdc.pl server spawning and waiting a bit more
intelligent. Rather than waiting a fixed (short) amount of time, it now polls
every second for a while, stopping if the connection is made. Thanks to Todd
McAnally for the initial suggestion.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Added image view to events lists. Again a partial implementation
of a suggested feature. If you click on the score column you will now get a
snapshot of the event frame with the highest score. This is to enable you to
quickly see what the event was about without having to watch the stream or view
all the static images.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Make delta times variable precision. A couple of problems had
been reported where long events got negative durations. This was due to an
overflow in a time difference routine. This had been operating on fixed
precision allowing high precision for short deltas. This routine has been
changed to allow variable precision and events will now have to be several days
long to wrap in this way.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fixed round detection problem. Although the existence or
otherwise of the round function is correctly detected, the appropriate header
file with the results of this test was not included which was not helpful. This
has been corrected. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fixed monitor rename bug. Renaming a monitor did not correctly
modify the events directory to reflect this. This has now been fixed.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>OPT_MPEG bug. A bug was reported (by Fernando Diaz) where the
results of the ZM_OPT_MPEG configuration variable was not correctly imported
into the scripts. This now happens as intended.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fixed zmvideo.pl event length bug. The zmvideo.pl script which is
used to generate video MPEG files tries to calculate the correct frame rate
based on the length of the event and the number of frames it contains.
Previously it did not take account of the pre and post event frames and so
passed a much shorter value to the mpeg encoder than it should. This will only
have affected short events encoded with ffmpeg but will have resulted in much
faster frame rates than necessary. This has now been corrected to take the
whole event length into account.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fixed remote camera memory leak. A memory leak was reported when
capturing with remote cameras, this is now fixed.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Orientation. Added option to rotate or invert captured images for
cameras mounted at unusual angles.</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fixed filter bug. A bug in the zmfilter.pl script was detected
and reported by Ernst Lehmann. This bug basically meant that events were not
checked as often as they should have been and many may have been left out for
filters that had no time component. The script has now been updated to reflect
Ernsts suggested changes.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Stylesheet change. Previously the stylesheet didnt really work
very well on Mozilla, Netscape and browsers other than IE. This turned out to
be because I was using HTML style comments in there instead of C style ones.
This has now been corrected so you should see the correct styles. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Zmconfig.pl ReadKey. Thanks to a ridiculously sensible suggestion
from Carlton Thomas this module has been removed from zmconfig.pl. Originally
Term::ReadKey was in there for funky single character unbuffered input but that
has long since disappeared so just regular perl input methods are used now.
This removes one of the most irritating features about ZoneMinder installs.</p>

0.9.11</a></h2>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Various new features and fixes.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Added stats view  If you have the RECORD_EVENT_STATS directive
set and are viewing a still image from an event you can now view the statistics
recorded for that frame. This tells you why that frame triggered or
participated in an alarm. This can be useful in tuning the various motion
detection parameters and seeing why events occurred.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Tabulated events  The main events view is now tabulated to look
a bit nicer.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>New video palette support  As well as the existing greyscale and
24 bit RGB palettes, you can now choose YUV420P and RGB565. Rewrote the
palette/colours area a bit to enable support for other palettes in the future
if requested. Bear in mind though that YUV palettes are converted into RGB
internally so if you have the choice RGB24 may be faster as it's the 'native'
format used within. </p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Added preclusive zones  Added a new zone type, the preclusive
zone. For full details see the relevant section above but in brief this is a
zone type that if alarmed will actually prevent an alarm. This completes the
pantheon of zone types I think.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fixed Mozilla JavaScript  Various JavaScript functionality did
not function on Mozilla, Netscape and other browsers. This is now (hopefully)
fixed.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Allow image and mpegs to be attached to emails  Added new tokens
(%EI1%, %EIM% and %EV%) to the filter emails. This allows the first alarm
image, most highly scored alarm image and an alarm MPEG to be attached to alarm
notification emails. Use %EV% especially with care!</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fixed possible motion detection bug  I found a few double
declared local variables left over from the rewrite. This may have affected the
motion detection algorithm. Fixed now anyway.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Modified scoring  Alarm scoring has been modified to give more
granularity for smaller events. This will have the effect of raising the scores
for small events while large ones will still be about the same.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fixed /cgi-bin path problem  Previously you could specify the
real path to you cgi-bin directory if you have one but not the web path. You
can now do both.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Improved video handling in browser  The MPEG/video area of the
web GUI had been a bit neglected and looked somewhat ugly. This has now been
improved to a degree and looks a bit nicer.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Added ffmpeg support  Historically ZoneMinder has only supported
the Berkeley mpeg encoder which was slow and rather limited. ZoneMinder now
supports the ffmpeg encoder as well which is much much faster and makes
generation of MPEG videos at realistic frame rates more of a reality. As ffmpeg
has so many options and everyone will probably want a different emphasis you
can now also specify additional ffmpeg options via zmconfig.pl.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Colourise greyscale image files  In past versions, captured
greyscale images were stored as JPEG files with a corresponding greyscale
colourspace. This saved a small amount of space but meant that mpeg_encode had
to do a conversion to encode them, and ffmpeg just fell in a heap. Now you can
optionally opt to have greyscale images saved as full 24 bit colourspace images
(they still look the same) at the price of a small penalty in CPU and disk but
allowing you to easily and quickly create MPEG files. This option is one by
default but can be switched off if you do not require any MPEG encoding.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fast RGB diffs  Previously ZoneMinder used quite a loose method
for calculating the differences between two colour images. This was basically
averaging the differences between each of the RGB components to get an overall
difference. This is still the default but by setting ZM_FAST_RGB_DIFFS to 'no'
you can now make it calculate the Y (or brightness value) of the pixels and use
the difference between those instead. This will be more accurate and responsive
to changes but is may be slower especially on old machines. There is a slight
double whammy here if you have a YUV palette for capture and set this option
off as the image will be converted to RGB and then partially converted back to
get the Y value. This is currently very inefficient and needs to be optimised.</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Fixed STRICT_VIDEO_CONFIG  Previously this actually behaved the
opposite of what it was supposed to, ie. if you wanted it strict it wasn't and
vice versa. Thanks to Dan Merillat for pointing this one out.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Web colour change  I thought the old red, green and amber text
colours were just a bit too gaudy so I've toned them down a bit. Hope you like
them!</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Source file restructuring - The source files have been broken up
and renamed extensively to support the first stage of the code being
straightened out. Likewise the class structure has been rationalised somewhat.
The php file names have also changed in some cases so it might be best to
delete all your php and css files from the zone minder install directory first
as the old ones won't be overwritten and will be left behind.</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Network camera support - A major change in this version is
support for remote or network cameras. This is currently implemented as series
of http grabs of stills rather than being able to break up motion jpeg streams.
However frame rates of from 2-10 should be achievable depending on your network
proximity to the cameras.</p>

</span></span>zmu suspend alarm option - Added new -n option to zmu to
effectively suspend alarm detection for a monitor. This is intended for short
term use and to support PTZ cameras where alarm detection is desired to be
suspended while the camera changes orientation or zoom level.</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>FPS limiting - Added a new option to monitors to add a maximum
capture rate. This allows you to limit the amount of hits a network camera gets
or to reduce the system load with many cameras. It also works with multi-port
cards and limiting the capture rate on one camera allows the spare FPS to be
allocated to other devices. For instance with two cameras and no throttle, I
get about 4FPS each. Throttling one to 2FPS allows the other to operate at 6FPS
so you can allocate your capture resources accordingly. This limiting can be
disabled while alarms are occurring as a global option in zmconfig.pl.</p>

anything else).</p>

first version to use short_open_tags in the PHP files. This caused grief to
some people so this script will put them back to the long verion.</p>

</span></span>Frame and event lengths fractional - A new field has been added
to the Frames table. This is 'Delta' and is a fractional number of seconds
relative to the event start time. This is intended to support the real-time
playback of events rather than just 'as fast as possible' or with a configured
delay as at present. The event length is now also fractional.</p>

changed via a dropdown to limit what can be entered. Don't forget to run the
zmalter script to update your DB.</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Added multiple options to zmu - You can now give multiple options
to zmu and get all the responses at once. However this is currently in a
deterministic order and not related to the order you give them.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Added -v/--verbose option to zmu - Zmu has been made more human
friendly though it still remains primarily for daemon use. Giving the -v or
--verbose option prints out a bit more as a response to each command.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

</span></span>Zmwatch now works on image delay and not fps - Previously the
zmwatch daemon detected capture daemon failure by trying to use the FPS
setting. This was imprecise and prone to false readings. It now uses the time
delay since the last captured image.</p>

zmpkg.pl is in charge of starting and stopping ZoneMinder as a whole package

use ZoneMinder as a service.</p>

<h1><a name="_Toc104622538"><span style='text-decoration:none'>11.<span
style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span>To Do</a></h1>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Seeing as ZoneMinder is so young and has kind of evolved
rather than being planned there are a bunch of improvements and enhancements
still to do, here is just a sample.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Perhaps split out devices - I think devices should probably be a
separate table and class from monitors. Not critical but would represent a
better model.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Comments - Needs many more, but that's just me I'm hopeless at
commenting things out. I'll get round to it soon though honest! You're lucky to
even get this document.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Optimised zones - The zones could do with being sorted out a bit
to optimise the processing of overlapping ones, at the moment you can waste
resource unless your zones are kept very tidy.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Create zones using server side image maps - This would make it
easier to precisely define and see where your zone is going to go. Not critical
but handy but a bugger to do.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Zone Definitions - Allow zones to be defined according to a
colour coded bitmap or as polygons. Currently all zones are rectangular this
would add a bit of flexibility. Would need a bit of a rewrite though. This will
incur a slight penalty on startup and a very slight one on processing for all
reasonably shaped zones. Work has already begun on this feature.</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Mouseover help - A bit more help popping up when you mouseover
things would be handy. A bit more help full stop actually.</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Automatic device configuration - Video 4 Linux supports various
device queries, it should be possible to get most of the device capability
information from the device itself. The zmu utility does this now but it's not
yet integrated into the web pages.</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText style='margin-left:36.0pt;text-indent:-18.0pt'><span
style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Extend the API. Well ok it's not really got an API yet but the
image data is held in shared memory in a very simple format. In theory you
could use the capture daemon to gab the images and other things could read them
from memory or the analysis daemon could read images from elsewhere. Either way
this should be done through an API, and would need a library I think. Also the
zmu utility could probably do a whole lot more to enable other things to manage
when the daemons become active etc.</p>

style='font-family:"Courier New"'>o<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
</span></span>Allow ZoneMinder to 'train' itself by allowing the user to select
events that are considered important and to discard those that should be
ignored. ZoneMinder will interpolate, add a bit of magic, and recommend
settings that will support this selection automatically thereafter. The hooks
for this are already in to some extent.</p>

</span></span>When opening a link to an event etc from a notification email the
window that is opened is just a regular browser window and not in the context
of a proper ZoneMinder web interface. Thus it comes up too big usually (not a
major issue) and also things like 'Delete' don't work as it wants to do things
to its parent (which is more of a major issue).</p>

</span></span>Yes, those are tabs in the indents; I like tabs so don't go
changing them to spaces please. Also, yes I  like my opening braces on their
own line most of the time, what's the point of brackets that don't line up?</p>

<p class=MsoPlainText>Everything else that isn't definitely broken is probably
deliberate, or was once anyway.</p>
